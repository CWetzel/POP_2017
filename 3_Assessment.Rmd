#Assessment

##General Model Specifications and Assumptions
Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.05 was used to estimate the parameters in the model. R4SS, revision 1.27.0, along with R version 3.3.2 were used to investigate and plot model fits. A summary of the data sources used in the model (details discussed above) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_plot}.


###Changes Between the 2011 Assessment Model and Current Model
The current model for `r spp` has many made many similar assumptions to the 2011 assessment but differs in some key ways.  This assessment disaggregated the fleets into a trawl/other gear, at-sea hake, historical foreign fleet, and research fleets.  The previous assessment implemented a single fleet where removals from all sources were aggregated together.  The separating of fleets applied in this assessment allowed for differing assumptions regarding current and historical discarding practices.  Although there are no compositional data available from the foreign fleet, it is assumed that very little to no discarding of fish occurred.  Additionally, the at-sea hake fishery removals represent both discarded and retained fish and hence an additional discard rate would not be appropriate.  Similar logic was applied in regard to survey removals.  

The historical landings used in the model differ from those used in 2011.  This assessment includes the first state provided historical reconstruction landings for Washington.  The historical reconstruction has removals starting in 1908 and has larger removals in the 1940s relative to those used in the 2011 assessment (Figure \ref{fig:Catch_Compare}).  The starting year for modeling the stock was revised to `r Dat_start_mod1`, the first year `r spp` landings exceeded 1 mt, rather than 1940 as modeled in the previous assessment, given the new information regarding historical removals prior to 1940.  Explorations were conducted relative to the model starting year and no differences were found between the `r Dat_start_mod1` start year compared to starting the model in 1892 which was the first year there is record landings of `r spp` between California, Oregon, and Washington.

Selectivity in this model is assumed to be length-based and is modeled using double-normal for all fleets, except the `r spp` survey which retained the previous assessment assumption of logistic selectivity. The previous assessment mirrored selectivity among the `r spp` and both slope surveys (AFSC and NWFSC).  This assessment allows for survey specific selectivity.

All fishery-independent indices have been re-evaluated for this assessment using a spatial-temporal delta generalized linear mixed model (VAST delta-GLMM) which is an updated approach from that used in 2011, which  did not incorporate spatial effects.  An additional update to the treatment of survey data was the decision to use the Triennial shelf survey as a single time-series ranging from 1980-2004.  The previous assessment opted to split this survey into an early (1980-1992) and a late (1995-2004) index of abundance based upon the change in southern sampling and a shift in survey timing.  Northern California is considered to be the southern end of `r spp` West Coast distribution with rare encounters in central or southern California waters.  The biological data from the Triennial shelf survey showed no discernible ontogenetic shifts in `r spp` during the early or late period of summer samples.  Based upon these investigations, the Triennial shelf survey was retained as a single index of abundance in this assessment.

Maturity and fecundity were updated for this assessment based upon new research. Fecundity for `r spp` used in this assessment was based on a re-evaluation of the fecundity of West Coast rockfish by Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017], updating the previous fecundity estimates used in the 2011 assessment [@dick_modeling_2009] (Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}).  Maturity in this assessment was based on examination of 537 fish samples which were used to estimate functional maturity, an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).  The updated maturity curve was based on maturity-at-length where the previous estimates used in 2011 were based on maturity-at-age (Figure \ref{fig:mat_compare}). 

In this assessment, the beta prior developed from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish was updated to the 2017 value (James Thorson, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) in preliminary models, with steepness fixed at an alternative value in the final base model.  Additionally, the prior for natural mortality was updated based on analysis conducted by Owen Hamel (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA), where female and male natural mortality were fixed at the median of the prior.


###Summary of Fleets and Areas

`r spp` are most frequently observed in Oregon and Washington waters in survey and fishery observations. Multiple fisheries encounter `r spp`. Bottom trawl, mid-water trawl, fixed gear, and the at-sea (mid-water) hake fisheries account for the majority of the current `r spp` landings.

The majority of removals of `r spp` are attributable to trawl gears with fixed gear accounting for a small fraction of the catches available within PacFIN. Trawl and fixed gears were combined into a coast-wide fleet. For the period from 1918 to the early 1990s, prior to the introduction of trip limits for rockfish, limited discarding of `r spp` was assumed. Observations of `r spp` in the Pikitch et al. [-@pikitch_evaluation_1988] data (1986-1987) allowed for a formal analysis of discard rates which were applied to the historical period of the fishery. Foreign trawl catches (1966-1976) were modeled as a single fleet.  The at-sea hake fishery operates as a mid-water fishery targeting Pacific whiting but encounters `r spp` as a bycatch species. This fleet was also modeled as a single fleet.


###Other Specifications

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model starting in `r Dat_start_mod1` with an accumulated age group at 60 years. Growth was estimated and natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior. The lengths in the population were tracked by 1 cm intervals and the length data were binned into 1 cm intervals. A curvilinear ageing imprecision relationship was estimated and used to model ageing error. Fecundity-at-length was fixed at the values from Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] for `r spp` and spawning output was defined in millions of eggs.

Age data for the commercial and at-sea hake fisheries, as well as the Triennial shelf survey, the `r spp`, the NWFSC slope, and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys were used in this assessment.  The ages from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey were entered into the model as conditional age-at-length. The assessment used length-frequencies collected by the fishery fleet, the at-sea hake fishery, the Triennial shelf, `r spp`, AFSC slope, NWFSC slope, and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys.

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that likely affects model uncertainty. Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1900-2014 to appropriately quantify uncertainty. The earliest length-composition data occur in 1966 and the earliest age data were in 1981. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations were from about the mid-1970s to 2013. The period from 1900-1974 was fit using an early series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from 1975-2014 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment (Figure \ref{fig:bias_ramp}), and 2015 onward was fit using forecast recruitment deviates with no bias adjustment. Methot and Taylor [-@methot_adjusting_2011] summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. The standard deviation of recruitment variability was assumed to be `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`.

The recommended selectivity in Stock Synthesis is the double normal parameterization and was used in this assessment for the all fleets, except the `r spp` survey which was assumed logistic based on the length composition data. Changes in retention curves were estimated for the commercial fishery fleet.

Time blocks for the fishery fleet are provided in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}. Fishery retention has changed over the modeled period due to management changes. The time block on the retention curves for the fishery were set from 1918-1991, 1992-2001, 2002-2007, 2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2016  based on available discarding data and changes in trip limits that likely resulted in changes to discarding patterns of `r spp`. No discarding was assumed in the at-sea hake and the foreign fisheries.

The following distributions were assumed for data fitting. Survey indices were lognormal, total discards were lognormal.


###Modeling Software and Model Bridging
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.05 by Dr. Richard Methot at the NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used, since it included improvements and corrections to older versions.  The previous assessment of `r spp` also used Stock Synthesis but a earlier version, 3.24, model bridging was performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:bridge}.


###Priors
A prior distribution was developed for natural mortality ($M$) from an analysis based on an assumed maximum age of 100 years. The analysis was performed by Owen Hamel (personal communications, NWFSC, NOAA) and used data from Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] to provide a lognormal distribution for natural mortality. The median of the lognormal prior is 0.054 and has a standard error of 0.438. 

The prior for steepness ($h$) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update of the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee in 2017. The prior is a beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.15. However, fixing steepness within the model resulted in what was determined to be an unrealistic relative depletion level (~ 97%$SB_0$), and it was decided to fix steepness at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`.  The previous assessment estimated and fixed steepness equal to 0.40.  The current data does not contain information regarding steepness and `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` was selected as an intermediate value between the prior and the previous assessment value.  The steepness value of `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` was contained within the estimated uncertainty envelope from the assessment model when either the prior value of 0.72 or 0.40 values were assumed.

###Data Weighting

Length and age-at-length compositions from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey were fit along with length and marginal age compositions from the fishery and other survey fleets. Length data started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Sections \ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey} (survey data) and \ref{fishery-length-and-age-data} (fishery data). Age-at-length data assumed that each age was a random sample within the length bin and started with a sample size equal to the number of fish in that length bin.  However, the 2016 NWFSC shelf-slope age-at-length data were variable compared to previous years for both males and females with observed fish being generally larger at age.  Model exploration determined that the model was more sensitive than would be reasonably expected to the inclusion of this data year.  Due to the increased variability within this data year and the model's sensitivity, the input sample size for this year was reduced to 50% of the number of fish within each length-age bin.  

One extra variability parameter was estimated and added to the input variance for the Triennial shelf and the NWFSC shelf-slope survey indices. Estimating additional variance for the CPUE and other surveys were explored and determined to not be required.  Vessels present in the WCGOP data were bootstrapped to provide uncertainty of the total discards (Table \ref{tab:Discard}).

The base assessment model was weighted using the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method does account for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution) as opposed to the McAllister and Ianelli [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method of looking at the difference between individual observations and predictions.


###Estimated And Fixed Parameters

There were 164 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 8 parameters for growth, 2 parameters for extra variability on the Triennial shelf and NWFSC shelf-slope survey indices, 24 parameters for selectivity, retention, and time blocking of the fleets and the surveys, 117 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:model_params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were done for steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"],3)` for females and males, which is the median of the prior.  The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`. Maturity-at-length was fixed as described in Section \ref{sex-ratio-maturation-and-fecundity}. Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model. Older `r spp` are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear, especially trawl gear. Domed shape selectivity was determined to provide the best fit to the data for the fishery fleet and the Triennial shelf survey. The final base model assumed asymptotic selectivity for the at-sea hake fishery, and all other surveys.

##Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the west coast of the US. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

The key assumptions in the model were that the assessed population is a single stock with biological parameters characterizing the entire coast, natural mortality and maturity-at-length has remained constant over the period modeled, weight-at-length has remained constant over the period modeled, the standard deviation in recruitment deviation is `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`,  and steepness is `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. These are simplifying assumptions that unfortunately cannot be verified or disproved. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for most of these assumptions to determine their effect on the results.

Structurally, the model assumed that the landings from each fleet were representative of the coastwide population, instead of specific areas, and fishing mortality prior to `r Dat_start_mod1` was negligible. It also assumed that discards were low prior to 1992.


###Alternate Models Considered

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2011 assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.05, which produced no discernible difference (Figure \ref{fig:bridge}). The updated landings data and discard rates added to the 2011 assessment produced insignificant differences in the relative scale of the population although the updated historical removals resulted in an increase in the estimate of unfished spawning output. Updating the survey indices produced small differences in the relative scale of the population. Adding age and length data each resulted in less of a population decline from the 1970s to pre-2000, resulting in an increase in the estimated  `r Project_firstyr` final stock status.  However, the addition of new data resulted in an early pattern within recruitment, indicating that the assumptions within the previous model may not represent the best fit to the current data.

This assessment estimated discards in the model, so time was spent investigating time blocks for changes in selectivity and retention to match the discard data as best as possible. Using major changes in management and observed changes in landings, a set of blocks for retention were determined for the fishery fleet. In the spirit of parsimony, as few blocks as possible were used, blocks were only for time periods with data or when we felt they were justified by changes in management.  

Natural mortality was also investigated and a new prior was developed assuming a maximum age of 100 years for females and males. The previous assessment estimated male natural mortality as an offset from a fixed female natural mortality.  This assessment attempted to estimate natural mortality for both sexes using the 2017 updated prior, but there was little to no information on natural mortality within the data and hence opted to fix the value for females within the base model.  Upon additional exploration, the model estimated very little difference in male natural mortality relative to females (< 0.002) and in the interest of selecting the model that fit the data with the fewest parameters required, males were fixed equal to the female natural mortality in the base model.

Finally, multiple models were investigated where steepness was either estimated, fixed at the prior, or at an alternate value. The assessment in 2011 determined that there was sufficient information concerning steepness where the parameter was estimated and then fixed at the estimated value of 0.40.  Based upon likelihood profiles performed on the current model, there was no longer support for a steepness value of 0.40. The likelihood profile was flat across various levels of steepness with a very small improvement in likelihood (<0.50 log likelihood units) at the lowest steepness values. Estimating steepness starting at the median of the "type C" prior, the meta-analysis prior evaluated omitting information from `r spp`,  of 0.76 resulted in very little if any movement from the median value due to the flat likelihood surface across values for this parameter with the final relative stock status for 2017 being estimated to > 100% of unfished spawning output.  Fixing steepness at the median of the prior of 0.72 resulted in relative stock status estimates for 2017 at 96.8% of unfished spawning output. It was determined that the resulting stock status estimate when steepness was fixed at the meta-analysis prior were overly optimistic and unrealistic given the biology and historical exploitation of `r spp`.   

###Convergence
Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. This was repeated 100 times and a better minimum was not found (Table \ref{tab:jitter}). The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

##Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:like}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts}. Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}. 

###Parameter Estimates
The estimates of maximum length and the von Bertanlaffy growth coefficient, $k$, were less than the the external estimates for males and females (Figure \ref{fig:Len_Age}), but were well within the 95% confidence interval given the estimated uncertainty (Table \ref{tab:model_params} and Figure \ref{fig:sizeatage}).  Female and male `r spp` grow quickly at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 20, with female `r spp` reaching  larger maximum lengths. 

Selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets.  The estimated selectivities for all fleets within the model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}.  The fishery selectivity was estimated dome shaped, reaching maximum selectivity for fish between 35 and 40 cm.  The at-sea hake fishery was estimated to have little selectivity for smaller `r spp` reaching full selectivity at the largest sizes. The foreign fleet for which only catch data are available was assumed to be identical to the main fishery, although a sensitivity was performed (not shown) that mirrored the foreign selectivity to that of the `r spp` survey selectivity resulting in a negligible difference in stock status. Survey selectivities, excluding the Triennial shelf survey, were estimated asymptotic during model explorations with the final selectivity fixed asymptotic in the final base model.  The Triennial shelf survey selectivity peaked at lengths between 25 and 30 cm and declined before reaching a constant selectivity for larger `r spp`.    

Retention curves were estimated for the fishery fleet only and were allowed to vary based upon discard data within the model over time (Figure \ref{fig:retention}).  Historical retention was estimated high and declined over time due to management restriction on landings of `r spp` with the lowest retention occurring in 2009 and 2010 prior to the implementation of ITQs.  Post-2011 retention was estimated to be nearly 100% for the fishery fleet. 

Additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input variability) for the Triennial shelf and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys were estimated within the model.  The estimated added variance for the Triennial shelf survey was high at `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Triennial(5)", 3], 3)`.  The model estimated a small added variance for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey of `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSCcombo(8)", 3], 3)`. Preliminary models explored estimating added variance for each of the other indices, but resulted in no added variance being estimated and hence were not estimated in the base model.  

Estimates of recruitment suggest that the `r spp` population is characterized by variable recruitment with occasional strong recruitments and periods of low recruitment (Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:recdevs}).  There is little information regarding recruitment prior to 1970 and the uncertainty in those estimates is expressed in the model. The four lowest recruitments (in ascending order) occurred in `r recdev.lowest[1]`, `r recdev.lowest[2]`, `r recdev.lowest[3]`, and `r recdev.lowest[4]`.   There are very large, but uncertain, estimates of recruitment in 2008, 2013, 2000, and 1999. The 2008 recruitment event is estimated to be larger by an order of magnitude compared to other recruitments estimated in the model.  The uncertainty interval in number of recruits is large based on the uncertainty surrounding the spawning output in that year.  However, the log recruitment deviation estimated uncertainty is low.  

###Fits to the Data
There are numerous types of data for which the fits are discussed: fishery CPUE index, survey abundance indices, discard data (biomass and length compositions), length composition data for the fisheries and surveys, marginal age compositions for the fisheries and surveys, and conditional age-at-length observations for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey

The fits to the fishery CPUE and five survey indices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:index_fits}.  Extra standard error was estimated for the Triennial shelf and NWFSC shelf-slope surveys.  The fishery CPUE and `r spp` survey index were fit well by the model.  The first two  years of the Triennial shelf survey index, 1980 and 1983, were much higher than the later years and were poorly fit by the model.  Both the AFSC and NWFSC slope survey indices were generally flat and fit well by the model. The recent NWFSC shelf-slope survey showed a variable trend over the time period with the 2016 data point being the highest estimate of the series and given the uncertainty around each data point (input and model estimated added variance) the model fit fell within the uncertainty interval for all years.

Fits to the total observed discard amounts required time blocks (Figure \ref{fig:discard_fits}).  Fits to the trawl discards from the Pikitch data in 1985-1987 were quite good.  The change in the discard rate modeled over the 1992-2001 was based on management restrictions which were assumed to have increased discarding practices in the fishery fleet.  The next required time block was based on the WCGOP data from 2002-2007 and were fit well by the model.  Discarding increased prior to the implementation to ITQs requiring blocks for 2008 and the 2009-2010 periods.  The model fit the very low post-ITQ discard rates based on the WCGOP data well.  The total estimated discard amount over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:total_discard}. 

Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of lengths observed by year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets.  Detailed fits to the length data by year and fleet are provided in Appendix \ref{appendix-a.-detailed-fit-to-length-composition-data}.  Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:length_agg}.  There are a few things that stand out when examining the aggregated length composition data. First, the sexed discard lengths appear to be poorly fit by the model but this is related to small sample sizes.  The NWFS slope survey lengths were under estimated by the model, but these data are over only two years.  Finally, both the Triennial shelf and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys select both young and old fish in contrast to the other data sources where typically only larger fish were observed. 

Discard lengths from WCGOP were fit well by the model and show no obvious pattern in the residuals (Figure \ref{fig:discard_len_pearson}).  The residuals to the fishery lengths clearly showed the growth differential between males and females where the majority of residuals at larger sizes were from female fish (Figure \ref{fig:fishery_len_pearson}).  The fishery showed large positive residuals for smaller fish for 2013-2016 which were attributed to the strong 2008 year class moving through the fishery.  The at-sea hake fishery did not show an obvious pattern in residuals but clearly showed the selectivity of larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:ashop_len_pearson}).  The residuals for each of the surveys are shown in Figures \ref{fig:pop_len_pearson}, \ref{fig:tri_len_pearson}, \ref{fig:afsc_len_pearson}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_len_pearson}, and  \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_len_pearson}. The Pearson residuals from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey clearly showed the strong year classes moving through the population. 

The model was weighted according to the Francis weights which adjust the weight given to a data set based on the fit to the mean lengths by year. The mean lengths from the fishery were consistent across the sampled period, showing only a decline in the mean length in 2013-2015 likely due to the large 2008 cohort (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_fishery}).  The at-sea hake fishery showed and increase in the mean length of fish observed to 2009 and then fluctuated at larger mean lengths thereafter (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_ashop}).  The mean lengths were consistent across the two sample years of the `r spp` survey (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_pop}). However, the model expected a decline in mean length over the period.  The Triennial shelf survey had a decreasing and then increasing trend in the mean lengths over the sample period (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_triennial}). The trend in the mean lengths observed by the AFSC slope survey was generally flat excluding the samples from 1997 which were smaller fish (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_afsc}). The NWFSC slope length data from 2001 and 2002 were highly variable with differing mean lengths between the years which were not fit well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_nwfsc}).  The mean length for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey declined in 2012 and 2016 due to a large observation of young small fish by the survey (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_len_nwfsccombo}).

Age data were fitted to as marginal age compositions for the main fishery fleet, the at-sea hake fleet, the `r spp` survey, the Triennial shelf survey, and the NWFSC slope survey.  The NWFSC shelf-slope ages were treated as conditional age-at-length data in order to facilitate the estimation of growth within the model.  The aggregated fits to the marginal age data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:age_agg}.  The aggregated age data was fit well for the fishery fleet which had the largest sample of ages.  The at-sea hake fleet and the surveys had significantly lower sample sizes which resulted in spiky patterns in the aggregated data.  However, the model generally captured the trend of the data.  Detailed fits to the age data by year and fleet are provided in Appendix \ref{appendix-b.-detailed-fit-to-age-composition-data}. 

The Pearson residuals for the main fishery fleet are show in Figure \ref{fig:fishery_age_pearson}.  There are diagonal patterns in the residuals across years which likely are cohorts moving through the fishery.  The at-sea hake fishery only had age data for four non-consecutive years, combined with the tendency of this fleet to select older fish, prevented general conclusions regarding fits to the data and cohort strength over time (Figure \ref{fig:ashop_age_pearson}). The `r spp` survey only had one year of age data (the 1979 were all surface reads) but both sexes had a larger observed number of older fish relative to the model estimates (Figure \ref{fig:pop_age_pearson}).  The Triennial shelf survey age data which ranged from 1989-2004 did not show a clear pattern in residuals (Figure \ref{fig:tri_age_pearson}).  However, the final year of the survey, 2004, did have an increase in positive residuals for female fish compared to earlier years.  The Pearson residuals for the two years of age data from NWFSC slope survey are shown in Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc_age_pearson}. The residual pattern differs between the years and by sex with positive residuals of male fish across ages in the 2001 data.

The observed and expected conditional age-at-length fits are shown in Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_1}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_2}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_3}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_4}, and \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_5} for the  NWFSC shelf-slope survey observations. The fits generally match the observations. Some outliers are apparent with large residuals.  The 2016 data varies from previous years where larger fish across all ages have higher observations compared to the model expectation.  

The age data were also weighted according to Francis weighting which adjust the weight given to a data set based on the fit to the mean age by year. The mean ages from the fishery appear to have declined in recent years which could be due to incoming cohorts (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_fishery}).  The at-sea hake fishery mean age are similar for 2006 and 2007 but both 2003 and 2014 have lower average age in the samples (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_ashop}).  The mean age for the Triennial shelf survey varied across the sampling period but the distribution of sampled ages were highly variable across the years (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_triennial}). The NWFSC slope had a decline in  the mean age between the two data years (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_nwfscslope}). The mean age for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey generally showed a declining trend over the time-series excluding 2012 and 2016 which sampled older fish relative to the other years  (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_nwfsccombo}).

###Population Trajectory
The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The predicted spawning output from the base model generally showed a slight decline over the time-series until  when the foreign fleet began. A short, but sharp decline occurred during the period of the foreign fishery in the late 1960s. The stock continued to decline minimally until `r low.ssb` (`r low.dep.value`) when a combination of strong recruitment and low catches resulted in an increase in spawning output at the end of the time-series. The recent increase is even faster for total biomass (Figure \ref{fig:total_bio}) because not all fish from the 2008 recruitment are mature (Figure \ref{fig:mat_compare}). The `r LastYR` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (`r Depl_mod1`) (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is high, especially in the early years. The standard deviation of the log of the spawning output in `r LastYR` is `r round(mod1$Pstar_sigma,2)`.

Recruitment deviations were estimated for the entire time-series that was modeled (Figure \ref{fig:recruits} and discussed in Section \ref{parameter-estimates}) and provide a more realistic portrayal of uncertainty. Recruitment predictions from the mid-1970s and early 1980s were mostly below average, with the 1999, 2000, 2008, and 2013 cohorts being the strongest over the modeled period. Many other stock assessments of rockfish along the west coast of the US have estimated a large recruitment event in 1999 (e.g., greenstriped rockfish [@hicks_status_2009], chilipepper rockfish [@field_status_2007], darkblotched rockfish [@gertseva_status_2015]). The 2008 year classes was estimated as the strongest year class measured to date for `r spp`. This year has been estimated to have very strong year classes for other West Coast stocks (e.g  darkblotched rockfish [@gertseva_status_2015], widow rockfish [@hicks_status_2015]). It may be worthwhile to investigate the periods of strong and weak year classes further to see if it is an artifact of the data, a consistent autocorrelation, or a result of the environment.

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a fixed value of steepness is shown in Figure \ref{fig:stock_recruit_curve} with estimated recruitments also shown. The stock is predicted to have never fallen to low enough levels that the steepness is obvious. However, the lowest levels of predicted spawning output showed some of the smallest recruitments and very few above average recruitments. Steepness was not estimated in this model, but sensitivities to an alternative value of steepness is discussed below.

###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Data weighting according to the harmonic mean.
  
  \item Fixed steepness at the prior value of 0.72.
  
  \item Estimate natural mortality for female and male `r spp`.
  
  \item Maturity relationship used in the previous assessment.
  
  \item Fecundity relationship used in the previous assessment.
  
  \item Split the Triennial shelf survey into two time-series, early (1980-1992) and late (1995-2004).
  
  \item Remove the historical commercial CPUE index.
  
  \item Inclusion of available Canadian fishery and survey data (does not constitute all data used in Canadian assessments).  This sensitivity includes Canadian fishery landings (1997-2016 with landings ranging from 260-400 mt by year) and survey removals (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016), no fishery or survey index of abundance, but with length and age composition from both the fishery and survey.  
  
  \item Inclusion of historical Washington research lengths.  
  
  \item Inclusion of Oregon special projects length and age data which are sampled at the dockside or processing facilities.  
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity1} and \ref{tab:Sensitivity2}.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning output and relative depletion are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens1_ssb}, \ref{fig:sens1_depl}, \ref{fig:sens2_ssb}, and \ref{fig:sens2_depl}.

The sensitivities which explored steepness or natural mortality had the largest change in estimated stock status relative to the base model.  Fixing steepness at the prior value resulted in the stock being near unfished spawning  output.  When natural mortality was estimated the estimated values were higher relative to the median of the prior used in base model, resulting in the relative depletion to be 93%.  

Including additional data from either Canada, Washington research lengths, and or Oregon special projects data resulted in estimated lower stock status relative to the base model.  However, the status was still well above the management target.  

Weighting the data according to the harmonic means resulted in the largest decrease in the estimated stock status relative to the base model with the stock being estimated at 68% of unfished spawning output.

The sensitivities that explored the removal of the CPUE index, the 2011 maturity, or fecundity relationship had little impact relative to the base model results.


###Retrospective Analysis

A 5-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, progressively (Figure \ref{fig:retro_sb} and \ref{fig:retro_recdev}). The initial scale of the spawning population was basically unchanged for all of these retrospectives. The estimation of the 2008 recruitment deviation decreased as more data was removed.  Overall, no alarming trends were present in the retrospective analysis.


###Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and over natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood was essentially flat between values of 0.30 - 0.80 (Figure \ref{fig:piner_h}).  Likelihood components by data source show that the fishery length and age data supports a low steepness value, but the NWFSC shelf-slope age data supports a higher value for steepness.  The Triennial shelf survey index indicates a low value of steepness while the other surveys do not provide information concerning steepness.  The relative depletion for `r spp` has a wide range across different assumed values of steepness (Figure \ref{fig:h_trajectory}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a natural mortality value of 0.06, but the 95% confidence interval extends over the majority of natural mortality values.  The age and length data likelihood contribution was minimized at natural morality values ranging from 0.055-0.06 (Figure \ref{fig:m_like}).  The relative depletion for `r spp` widely varied across alternative values of natural mortality (Figure \ref{fig:m_trajectory}).

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of 9.30 (Figure \ref{fig:piner_R0}).  The fishery and survey composition data was in opposition regarding values of $R_0$ where the fishery length and age data indicated lower values of $R_0$ while the survey ages from the `r spp` and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys indicated a higher value.


###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total yields (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` millions of eggs. The recent catches (landings plus discards) have been below the point estimate of potential long-term yields calculated using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference point and the population has been increasing over the last 15 years.

The predicted spawning output from the base model generally showed a sharp decline during the 1960s followed by less of a decline until `r low.ssb` (Figure \ref{fig:ssb}). Since 2001, the spawning output has been rapidly increasing due to small catches, and recently, above average recruitment. The `r LastYR` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, exceeded the current estimates of the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) throughout the 1960s as seen in Figure \ref{fig:SPR}. Recent exploitation rates on `r spp` were predicted to be much less than target levels. In recent years, the stock has experienced exploitation rates that have been below the target level while the spawning output level has remained above the target level.

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`.
