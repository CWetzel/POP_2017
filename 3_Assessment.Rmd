#Assessment

##General Model Specifications and Assumptions
Stock Synthesis v3.30.03.05 was used to estimate the parameters in the model. R4SS, revision 1.27.0, along with R version 3.3.2 were used to investigate and plot model fits. A summary of the data sources used in the model (details discussed above) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_plot}.

Stock Synthesis has many options when setting up a model and the assessment model for `r spp` was set up in the following manner.

###Changes between the 2011 assessment model and current model
The current model for `r spp` has many made many similar assumptions to the 2011 assessment but differs in some key ways.  This assessment disaggrated the fleets into a trawl/other gear, at-sea hake, historical foreign fleet, and research fleets.  The previous assessment implemented a single fleet where removal from all sources were aggregated together.  The seperating of fleets applied in this assessment allowed for differing assumptions regarding current and historical discarding practices.  Although there are no compositional data available from the foreign fleet, it is assumed that very little discarding to no discarding of fish occured.  Additionally, the at-sea hake fishery removals are represent both discarded and retained fish and hence an additional discard rate would not be appropriate.  Similar logic was applied in regard to survey and research removals.  

The historical landing used in the model differs from those used in 2011.  The assessment includes the first state provided historical reconstruction landings for Washington state.  The historical reconstruction provided `r spp` landing within Washington state starting in 1916 and have larger removals in the 1940s relative to those used in 2011 \ref{fig:Catch_Compare}.  Given the increase in historical removals prior to 1940, the 2011 model starting year, the starting year for modeling the stock was revised to 1918, the first year `r spp` landings exceeded 1 mt, for this assessment.  Explorations were conducted relative to the model starting year and no differences were found between the 1918 start year compared to starting the model in 1892, the first record of `r spp` landings between California, Oregon, and Washington catch data.

Selectivity in this model is assumed to be length-based and is modeled using double-normal for all fleets, expect the `r spp` survey which retained the previous assessment assumption of logistic selectivity. The previous assessment mirrored selectivity amont the `r spp` and both slope surveys (AFSC and NWFSC).  This assessment allow for survey specific estimated double-normal selectivity.

All fishery-independent indices have been reevaluated for this assessment using a spatial-temporal delta generalized linear mixed model (VAST delta-GLMM) which is updated from 2011 which used a bayesian delta-GLMM which did not incorporate spatial effects.  An additional update to the treatment of survey data was the decision to use the Triennial survey as a single time series ranging from 1980-2004.  The previous assessment opted to split this survey into early and a late index of abundance based upon the change in southern sampling and a shift in survey timing.  Northern California is considered to be the southern end of `r spp` West Coast distribution with rare encounters in central or southern California waters.  The biological data from the Triennial survey showed no discernable ontogenetic shifts in `r spp` during the early or late period of summer samples.  Based upon these investigations, the Triennial survey was retained as a single index of abundance.

Maturity and fecundity were updated for this assessment based upon new research. Fecundity for `r spp` used in this assessment was base on reevaluation of the fecundity of West Coast rockfish by Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] updating the previous fecundity estimates used in the 2011 assessment [@dick_modeling_2009] (Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}).  Maturity in this assessment was based on examination of 537 fish samples which were used to estimate functional maturity, an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (M. Head, pers comm, NWFSC, NOAA).  The updated maturity curve was based on maturity-at-length where the previous estimates used in 2011 were based on maturity-at-age (Figure \ref{fig:mat_compare}). 

In this assessment, the beta prior developed from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish was updated to the 2017 value (J. Thorson, pers comm, NWFSC, NOAA) in preliminary models, with steepness fixed in the final base model.  Additionally, the prior for natural mortality was updated base on analysis conducted by Owen Hamel (pers comm, NWFSC, NOAA), where female natural mortality was fixed at the prior median with males estimated as an offset from the female value.


###Summary of Fleets and Areas

`r spp` are most frequently observed in Oregon and Washington waters, however, they are observed along the entire US West Coast in survey and fishery observations. Multiple fisheries encounter `r spp`. Trawl, fixed gear, and the at-sea (mid-water) hake fisheries account for the majority of the `r spp` landings both historically and currently.

The majoirty of removals of `r spp` were observed by eht bottom trawl fishery with fixed gear accounting for a small fraction of the catches avaiable within PacFIN. Trawl and fixed gears were combined into a coast-wide fleet. For the period from 1918 to the early 1990s, prior to the introduction of trip limits for rockfish, limited discarding of `r spp` was assumed. Observations of `r spp` in the Pikitch et al. (1988) data (1986-1987) allowed for a formal analysis of discard rates which were applied to the historical period of the fishery. Foreign trawl catches (1966-1976) was modeled as a single fleet.  The at-sea fishery operates as a mid-water fishery targeting Pacific whiting but encounters `r spp` as a bycatch species. This fleet was also modeled as a single fleet.


###Other Specifications

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model starting in 1918 with an accumulated age group at 60 years. Growth was estimated and natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior. The lengths in the population were tracked by 1 cm intervals and the length data were binned into 1 cm intervals. A curvilinear ageing imprecision relationship was estimated and used to model ageing error. Fecundity-at-length was defined fixed at the values from Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] for `r spp` and spawning output was defined in millions of eggs.

The Triennial survey was kept as a single series. Assessment of other groundfish have split this survey into an early and a late series, based mostly on the shift to deeper depths and the timing of the survey, by estimating different catchability parameters and selectivity parameters for each period. Age data were available for the commercial and at-sea hake fishery, as well as the Triennial, the `r spp`, the NWFSC slope, and the NWFSC shelf-slope survies.  The ages from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey and were entered into the model as conditional age-at-length. Length-frequencies were calculated for the Triennial, `r spp`, AFSC slope, NWFSC slope,  and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys within each stratum, and then combined across strata using the biomass in each stratum as the weighting factor. This reduced the influence of a few fish observed in a large area.

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that likely affects model uncertainty. It was decided to estimate recruitment deviations from 1900-2014 to appropriately quantify uncertainty. The earliest length-composition data occur in 1966 and the earliest age data were in 1981. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations were from about the mid-1970s to about 2011. The period from 1900-1974 was fit using an early series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from 1975-2014 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment, and 2015 onward was fit using forecast recruitment deviates with little bias adjustment. Methot and Taylor [-@methot_adjusting_2011] summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. Recruitment deviation was assumed to be `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`.

The recommended selectivity type in Stock Synthesis is the double normal and was used in this assessment for the all fleets, except the `r spp` survey which was assumed logistic based on the length composition data. Changes in retention curves were estimated for the commercial fishery.

Time blocks for the bottom trawl, midwater trawl, and hook-and-line fishery are provided in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}. Fishery selectivity retention has changed over the modeled period due to management changes. The time block on the retention curves for the trawl fishery were set from 1918-1991, 1992-2001, 2002-2007, 2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2016  based on available discarding data and changes in trip limits that likely resulted in changes to discarding patterns of `r spp`. No discarding was assumed in the at-sea hake and the foreign fisheries.

The following distributions were assumed for data fitting. Survey indices were lognormal, total discards were lognormal.


###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.05 by Dr. Richard Methot at the NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used, since it included improvements and corrections to older versions.  The previous assessment of `r spp` also used Stock Synthesis but a earlier version, 3.24, model bridging was performed between both version of Stock Synthesis and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:bridge}.


###Priors
A prior distribution was developed for the natural mortality parameter from an analysis of a maximum age of 100 years. The analysis was performed by Owen Hamel (pers comm, NWFSC, NOAA) and used data from Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] to provide a lognormal distribution for natural mortality. The median of the lognormal prior is 0.054 and has a standard error of 0.4384343. 

The prior for steepness ($h$) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update of the Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by J. Thorson (pers comm, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the SSC in 2017. The prior is a beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.15. However, fixing steepness within the model resulted in unrealistic relative biomass levels ($>$ 1), it was also decided to fix steepness at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`.  The previous assessment estimated and fixed steepness equal to 0.40.  The current data does not contain information regarding steepness and `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` was selected as an intermediate value between the prior and the previous assessment value.  The steepness value of `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` was contained within the estimated uncertainty envelope from the assessment model when either the prior value of 0.72 or 0.40 values were assumed.

###Data Weighting

The base case was weighted such that the various data sources were mostly consistent with each other in terms of the relationship between input and effective sample sizes. Length and age-at-length compositions from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey were fit along with length and marginal age compositions from the fishery fleets. Length data started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Section \ref{fishery-length-and-age-data} and \ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}. Age-at-length data assumed that each age was a random sample within the length bin and started with a sample size equal to the number of fish in that length bin.  However, the 2016 NWFSC shelf-slope age-at-length data was variable compared to previous years for both males and females relative to all other years with observed fish being smaller at age.  Due to the increased variability within this data year, the effective sample size for this year was reduced to 50% of the number of fish within each length-age bin.  

One extra variability parameter that was added to the input variance was estimated for the Triennial and the NWFSC shelf-slope survey indices. Vessels present in the WCGOP data were bootstrapped to provide uncertainty of the total discards (Table \ref{tab:Discard}).

The base case assessment model was weighted based on the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method does account for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution) as opposed to the McAllister and Ianelli [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method of looking at the difference between individual observations and predictions.


###Estimated And Fixed Parameters

There were 164 estimated parameters in the base case model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 8 parameters for growth, 2 parameters for extra variability on the Triennial and NWFSC shelf-slope surveys indices, 24 parameters for selectivity, retention, and time blocking of the fleets and the surveys, 117 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:model_params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were done for steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"],3)` for females and males, which is the median of the prior.  The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`. Maturity at age was fixed as described in Section \ref{sex-ratio-maturation-and-fecundity}. Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for both the fishery and the surveys. Older `r spp` are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear, especially trawl gear. Domed shape selectivity was assumed for the fishery fleet and the Triennial survey. The final base model assumed asymptotic selectivity for the at-sea hake fishery, and all other surveys.

##Model Selection and Evaluation

The base case assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a biomass trajectory for the population of `r spp` on the west coast of the United States. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base case model.

###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

The key assumptions in the model were that the assessed population is a single stock with biological parameters characterizing the entire coast, maturity at age has remained constant over the period modeled, weight-at-length has remained constant over the period modeled, the standard deviation in recruitment deviation is `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`,  and steepness is `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. These are simplifying assumptions that unfortunately cannot be verified or disproven. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for most of these assumptions to determine their effect on the results.

Structurally, the model assumed that the catches from each fleet were representative of the coastwide population, instead of specific areas, and fishing mortality prior to 1918 was negligible. It also assumed that discards were low prior to 1992 and after 2010.


###Alternate Models Considered
The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2011 assessment to SS version 3.24U, which produced no discernable difference. The updated catch series with discards added per the 2011 assessment produced insignificant differences in the relative scale of the population although the updated historical removals resulted in an increase in the estimate of unfished biomass.   Updating the survey indices produced small differences in the relative scale of the population. Adding age and length data each resulted in less of a population decline from the 1970s to pre-2000, resulting in an increase in the estimated final stock status as of 2017.  However, the addition of new data resulted in an early pattern within recruitment, indicating that the assumptions within the previous model may not represent the best fit to the current data.

This assessment estimated discards in the model, so time was spent investigating time blocks for changes in selectivity and retention to match the limited discard data as best as possible. Using major changes in management and observed changes in landings, a set of blocks for retention was found for the bottom trawl fleets. In the spirit of parsimony, we used as few blocks as possible, allowed blocks only for time periods with data, and added new blocks when we felt they were justified by changes in management and they improved the fit to the data.

Natural mortality was also investigated and a new prior was developed assuming a maximum age of 100 years for females and males. The previous assessment estimated male natural mortality as an offset from female natural mortality which was fixed at the median of the 2011 prior.  This assessment attempted to estimate natural mortality for both sexes using the 2017 updated prior, but there was little to no information on natural mortality within the data and hence opted to fix the value for females.  Upon additional exploration, the model estimated very little difference in male natural mortality relative to females (< 0.002) and in the interest of selecting the model that fit the data with the fewest parameters required, males were fixed equal to the female natural mortality.

Finally, multiple models were investigated where steepness either estimated, fixed at the prior, or at an alternate value. The assessment in 2011 determined that there was sufficient information concerning steepness where the parameter was estimated and then fixed at 0.40.  Based upon likelihood profiles performed on the current assessment, there was no longer support for a steepness value of 0.40 and the likelihood profile was flat across various levels of steepness with a very small improvement in likelihood (<0.50 log likelihood units) at the lowest steepness values. Estimating steepness starting at the median of the "type C" prior, the meta-analysis prior evaluated omitting information from `r spp`,  of 0.76 resulted in very little if any movement from the median value due to the flat likelihood surface across values for this parameter with final relative stock status for 2017 being estimated to > 100% of unfished biomass.  Fixing steepness at the median of the prior of 0.72 resulted in relative stock status estimates for 2017 at 98.6% of unfished biomass. It was determined that the resulting stock status estimates when steepness was fixed at the meta-analysis prior were overly optomistic and unrealistic given the biology and historical exploitation of `r spp`.   

###Convergence
Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. This was repeated 100 times and a better minimum was not found (Table \ref{tab:jitter}). The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base case as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

##Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:like}. Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mdo1}. Estimates of key derived parameters and approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts}.

###Parameter Estimates
The estimates of maximum length and the von Bertanlaffy growth coefficient, $k$, were less than the the external estimates for males and females (Figure \ref{fig:Len_Age}, but were well within the 95% confidence interval given the estimated uncertainty (Table \ref{tab:model_params} and Figure \ref{fig:sizeatage}).  Female and male `r spp` grow quickly at younger ages, reaching near maximimum length by age 20 with female `r spp` having a larger maximum length. 

Selectivity curves were estimated for commercial and survey fleets.  The estimated selectivity for all fleets within the model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}.  The fishery selectivity was estimated dome shaped, reaching maximum selectivity for fish between 35 and 40 cm.  The At-Sea Hake fishery was estimated to have little selectivity for smaller `r spp` and only reaching full selectivity at the largest sizes.  Survey selectivities, excluding the Triennial survey, were estimated asymptotic during model explorations with the final selectivity fixed asymptotic in the final base model.  The Triennial survey selectivity peaked at lengths between 25 and 30 cm and declined before reaching a constant selectivity for larger `r spp`. The foreign fleet for which only catch data are available was assumed to be identical to the main fishery, although a sensitivity was performed (not shown) that mirrored the foreign selectivity to that of the `r spp` survey selectivity resulting in only a small difference in stock status.   

Retention curves were estimated for the fishery fleet only and were allowed to vary based upon discard data within the model over time (Figure \ref{fig:retention}).  Historical retention was estimated high and declined over time due to management restriction on catch of `r spp` with the lowest retention occuring in 2009 and 2010 prior to the implementation of ITQs.  Post-2011 retention was estimated to be nearly 100% for the fishery fleet. 

Additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input variability) for the Triennial and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys were estimated within the model.  The estimated added variance for the Triennial survey was high at `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Triennial(5)", 3], 3)`.  The model estimated a small added variance for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey of `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSCcombo(8)", 3], 3)`. Preliminary models explored estimating added variance for each of the other indices, but resulted in no added variance being estimated and hence where not estimated in the base model.  

Estimates of recruitment suggest that the `r spp` population is characterized by variable recruitment with occasional strong recruitments and periods of low recruitment (Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:recdevs}).  There is little information regarding recruitment prior to 1970 and the uncertainty in those estimates is expressed in the model. The four lowest recruitments (in ascending order) occurred in `r recdev.lowest[1]`, `r recdev.lowest[2]`, `r recdev.lowest[3]`, and `r recdev.lowest[4]`.   There are very large, but uncertain, estimates of recruitment in 2008, 2013, 2000, and 1999. The 2008 recruitment event is estimated to be larger by an order of magnitude than any other recruitment estimated in the model.  The uncertainty interval in number of recruits is large for this year based on the uncertainty surrounding the spawning output in that year.  However, the log recruitment deviation estimated uncertainty is low.  

###Fits to the Data
There are numerous types of data for which the fits are discussed: survey abundance indices, discard data (biomass and length compositions), length composition data for the fisheries and surveys, marginal age compositions for the fisheries and surveys, and conditional age-at-length observations for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey

The fits the fishery CPUE and five survey indices are shown in Figure \ref{fig:index_fits}.  Extra standard error was estimated for the Triennial and NWFSC shelf-slope surveys.  The fishery CPUE and `r spp` survey index were fit well by the model.  The first two  years of the Triennial survey index, 1980 and 1983, were much higher than the later years and were poorly fit by the model.  Both the AFSC and NWFSC slope survey indices were generally flat and fit well by the model. The recent NWFSC shelf-slope survey showed a variable trend over the time period with the 2016 data point being the highest estimate of the series.

Fits to the total observed discard amounts required time blocks (Figure \ref{fig:discard_fits}).  Fits to the trawl discards from the Pikitch data in 1985-1987 were quite good.  Discard rate change modeled over the 1992 - 2001 was based on management restrictions which were assumed to have increased discarding practices in the fishery fleet.  The next required time block was based on the WCGOP data from 2002-2007 and were fit well by the model.  Discarding increased prior to the implementation to ITQs requiring blocks for 2008 and the 2009-2010 periods.  The model fit the very low post-ITQ discard rates based on the WCGOP data well.   

Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of lengths observed by year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets.  Discard lengths from the Pikitch data (1986) and the WCGOP were fit well by the model and show no obvious pattern in the residuals (Figures \ref{fig:_mod1_comp_lenfit_flt1mkt} and \ref{fig:mod1_2_comp_lenfit_residsflt1mkt1}).

###Population trajectory

###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Data weighting according to the harmonic mean.
  
  \item Fixed steepness at the prior value of 0.72.
  
  \item Estimate natural mortality for female and male `r spp`.
  
  \item Maturity relationship used in the previous assessment.
  
  \item Fecundity relationship used in the previous assessment.
  
  \item Split the Triennial survey into two time-series, early (1980-1995) and late (1998-2004).
  
  \item Remove the historical commercial CPUE index.
  
  \item Inclusion of available Canadian fishery and survey data (does not constitute all data used in Canadian assessments).
  
  \item Inclusion of historical Washington research lengths.
  
  \item Inclusion of Oregon special projects length and age data which are sampled at the dockside of processing facilities.
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key paramters from each sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity1} and \ref{tab:Sensitivity2}.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning output and relative biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens1_ssb}, \ref{fig:sens1_depl}, \ref{fig:sens2_ssb}, and \ref{fig:sens2_depl}.

The sensitivities which explored steepness or natural mortality had the largest change in estimated stock status relative to the base model.  Fixing steepness at the prior value resulted in the stock being near unfished spawning biomass output.  When natural mortality was esimated the esimated values were higher relative to the median of the prior used in base model, resulting in the relative biomass to be > 93%.  

Including additional data from either Canada, Washington research lengths, and or Oregon special projects data resulted in estimated lower stock status relative to the base model.  However, the status was still well above the management target.  

Weighting the data according to the harmonic means resulted in the largest decrease in the estimated stock status relative to the base model with the stock being estimated at 68% of unfished biomass.


###Retrospective Analysis

A 5-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, progressively (Figure \ref{fig:retro_sb} and \ref{fig:retro_recdev}). The initial scale of the spawning population was basically unchanged for all of these retrospectives. The estimation of the 2008 recruitment deviation decreased as more data was removed.  Overall, no alarming trends were present in the retrospective analysis.

A look at past assessments shows that the prediction of spawning biomass has generally increased with each assessment (Figure 78). This assessment (2015) predicts the largest spawning biomass. All assessments show similar trends.
 

###Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and over natural mortality values seperately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at a steepness of 0.30, but the 95% confidence interval extends over the entire range of possible steepness values (excluding 0.20) (Figure \ref{fig:piner_h}).  Likelihood components by data source show that the fishery length and age data supports a low steepness value, but the NWFSC shelf-slope age data supports a higher value for steepness.  The Triennial survey index indicates a low value of steepness while the other surveys do not provide information concerning steepness.  The relative biomass for `r spp` has a wide range across different assumed values of steepness (Figure \ref{fig:h_trajectory}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a natural mortality value of 0.06, but the 95% confidence interval extends over the majority of natural moratility values.  The age and length data likelihood contribution was minimized at natural morality values ranging from 0.055-0.06 (Figure \ref{fig:m_like}).  The relative biomass for `r spp` widely varied across alternative values of natural mortality (Figure \ref{fig:m_trajectory}).

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likehood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of 9.30 (Figure \ref{fig:piner_R0}.  The fishery and survey composition data was in opposition regarding values of $R_0$ where the fishery legnth and age data indicated lower values or $R_0$ while the survey ages from the `r spp` and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys indicated a higher value.


###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total yields (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` millions of eggs. The recent catches (landings plus discards) have been below the point estimate of potential long-term yields calculated using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference point and the population has been increasing over the last decade.

The predicted spawning biomass from the base model generally showed a sharp decline during the 1960s, steep increase above unfished equilibrium levels, followed by less of a decline until 2001 (Figure \ref{fig:ssb}). Since 2001, the spawning biomass has been increasing due to small catches, and recently, above average recruitment. The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning biomass (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity (relative 1-SPR) exceeded the current estimates of the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) throughout the 1960s as seen in Figure \ref{fig:SPR}. Recent exploitation rates on `r spp` were predicted to be much less than target levels. In recent years, the stock has experienced exploitation rates that have been below the target level while the biomass level has remained above the target level.

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`.
