#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated ACL for years 2019-2028 and a catch allocation equal to the percentages for each fleet over the period of 2014-2016 predicts an increase in the spawning output due to large 2008 cohort, with a slight downturn beginning in 2023 (Table \ref{tab:Forecast_mod1}). Additional projections with the current ACL or the SPR50 MSY using the low and high states of nature are provided in Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1_back} and show the spawning output remaining well above the management target for either catch level.
