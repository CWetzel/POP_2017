#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated ACL for years 2019-2028 and a catch allocation equal to the percentages for each fleet over the period of 2014-2016 predicts an increase in the spawning output due to the large 2008 cohort, with a slight downturn beginning in 2023 (Table \ref{tab:Forecast_mod1}). The removals in 2017 and 2018 were set at the defined management specification of 281 mt for each year assuming full attainment. Additional projections with the current ACL or the SPR50 MSY using the low and high states of nature are provided in Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1_back} and show the spawning output remaining well above the management target for either catch level.
