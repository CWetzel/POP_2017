\subsection*{Stock}\label{stock}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock}

This assessment reports the status of the Pacific ocean perch rockfish
(\emph{Sebastes alutus}) off the US West Coast from Northern California
to the Canadian Border using data through 2017. Pacific ocean perch are
most abundant in the Gulf of Alaska and have observed off of Japan, in
the Bering Sea, and south to Baja California, although they are sparse
south of Oregon and rare in southern California. Although catches north
of the US-Canada border were not included in this assessment, it is not
certain the connectivity of these populations with contribution to the
biomass possibly through adult migration and/or larval dispersion. To
date, no significant genetic differences have been found in the range
covered by this assessment.

\subsection*{Landings}\label{landings}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Landings}

The first year that harvest of Pacific ocean perch exceeded 1 mt off the
US West Coast first occurred in 1918. Catches ramped up in the 1940s
with large removals in Washington waters. During the 1950s the removals
primary occurred in Oregon waters with catches from Washington declining
following the 1940s. The largest removals occurring between 1966-1968
were largely a result of harvest by foreign vessels. The fishery
proceeded with more moderate removals ranging between 1165 to 2619
metric tons (mt) per year between 1969 and 1980. Removals generally
declined from 1981 to 1994 to between 1031 and 1616 mt per year. Pacific
ocean perch was declared overfished in 1999, resulting in large
reductions in harvest in recent years since the declaration. Since 2000,
catches of Pacific ocean perch have ranged between 54-267 mt, with
catches in 2016 totaling 65 mt.

Pacific ocean perch are a desirable market species and discarding has
historically been low. However, management restrictions (e.g.~trip
limits) have resulted in increased discarding since the early 1990s.
During the 2000s discarding increased for Pacific ocean perch due to
harvest restrictions imposed to allow rebuilding, with estimated discard
rates from the bottom trawl fishery peaking in 2009 and 2010 to discard
rates of 50.4\%, prior to implementation of catch shares in 2011. Since
2011, discarding of Pacific ocean perch has been estimated to be less
than 3.5\% based on observer data.

\subsection*{Data and Assessment}\label{data-and-assessment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data and Assessment}

This a new full assessment for Pacific ocean perch which was last
assessed in 2011. In this assessment, all aspects of the model including
catches, data, and modelling assumptions were re-evaluated as much as
possible. The assessment was conducted using the length- and
age-structured modeling software Stock Synthesis (version 3.30.03.05).
The coastwide population was modeled assuming separate growth and
mortality parameters for each sex (a two-sex model) from 1918 to 2017,
and forecasted beyond 2017.

All of the sources of data for Pacific ocean perch have been
re-evaluated for 2017, excluding the historical fishery catch-per-unit
time series. Changes of varying degrees have occurred in the data from
those used in previous assessments. These current data represent the
best available scientific information. The landings history has been
updated and extended back to 1918. Harvest was negligible prior to that
year. Survey data from the Alaska and Northwest Fisheries Science
Centers have been used to construct indices of abundance using analyzed
using a spatio-temporal delta-model. Length, marginal age or conditional
age-at-length compositions were also created for each fishery
independent data source.

The definition of fishing fleets have been changed from those in the
2011 assessment. Three fishing fleets were specified within the model:
1) a combined bottom trawl, mid-water trawl and fixed gear fleet where
only a small fraction of Pacific ocean perch occurring by fixed gear
(termed the fishery fleet), 2) the historical foreign fleet, and 3) the
At-sea hake fishery. The fleet grouping were based on discarding
practices. The fishery fleet estimated a retention curve based upon
discarding data and known management restrictions. However, very little
if any discarding is assumed to have occurred by the foreign fleet and
the catch reported by the At-sea hake fishery accounts for both
discarded and landed fish and hence, no additional mortality was
estimated for each of these fleets.

The assessment uses landings data and discard-fraction estimates;
catch-per-unit-of-effort and survey indices; length or age composition
data for each year and fishery or survey (with conditional age-at-length
compositional data for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey); information on
weight-at-length, maturity-at-length, and fecundity-at-length; priors on
natural mortality and the steepness of the Beverton-Holt
stock-recruitment relationship; and estimates of ageing error.
Recruitment at ``equilibrium biomass'', length-based selectivity of the
fishery and surveys, retention of the fishery, catchability of the
surveys, growth, the time-series of biomass, age and size structure, and
current and projected future stock status are outputs of the model.
Natural mortality and steepness were fixed in the final model. This was
done due to relatively flat likelihood surfaces, such that fixing
parameters and then varying them was deemed the best way to characterize
uncertainty.

Although there are many types of data available for Pacific ocean perch
since the 1980s, which were used in this assessment, there is little
information about steepness and natural mortality. Estimates of
steepness are uncertain partly because of variable recruitment.
Uncertainty in natural mortality is common in many fish stock
assessments even when length and age data are available.

A number of sources of uncertainty are explicitly included in this
assessment. This assessment includes gender differences in growth, a
non-linear relationship between individual spawner biomass and effective
spawning output, and an updated relationship between length and
maturity, based upon non-published information (M. Head, personal
communication, NOAA, NWFSC). As is always the case, overall uncertainty
is greater than that predicted by a single model specification. Among
other sources of uncertainty that are not included in the current model
are the degree of connectivity between the stocks of Pacific ocean perch
off of Vancouver Island, British Columbia and those in PFMC waters, and
the effect of climatic variables on recruitment, growth and survival of
Pacific ocean perch.

A reference case was selected which adequately captures the central
tendency for those sources of uncertainty considered in the model.

\subsection*{Stock Biomass}\label{stock-biomass}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock Biomass}

The predicted spawning biomass from the base model generally showed a
slight decline over the time series until 1966 when the foreign fleet
began. A short, but sharp decline occurred, followed by a period of the
stock biomass stabilizing or with a minimal decline until the late
1990s. The stock showed increases in stock size following the year 2000
due to a combination of strong recruitment and low catches. The 2017
estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning
biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished spawning biomass is
76.1\% (\textasciitilde{}95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\)
53.8\%-98.4\%). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic
variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning
biomass is high.

\subsection*{Recruitment}\label{recruitment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Recruitment}

Recruitment deviations were estimated for the entire time-series
modeled. There is little information regarding recruitment prior to
1965, and the uncertainty in these estimates is expressed in the model.
Historically, there are estimates of large recruitments in 1999 and
2000. In recent years, a recruitment of unprecedented size is estimated
to have occurred in 2008 but is highly uncertain. Additionally, there is
early evidence of a strong recruitment in 2013. The four lowest
recruitments estimated within the model (in ascending order) occurred in
2012, 2003, 1998, and 2005.

\subsection*{Exploitation status}\label{exploitation-status}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Exploitation status}

The spawning biomass of Pacific ocean perch reached a low in 1994.
Catches for Pacific ocean perch decreased significantly in 2000 compared
to previous years. The estimated relative biomass was possibly below the
overfished level in the early 2000s, but has likely remained above that
level otherwise, and currently is significantly greater than the 40\%
unfished spawning biomass target. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s
the exploitation rate and (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{50\%}) were
mostly above target levels. Recent exploitation rates on Pacific ocean
perch were predicted to be significantly below target levels.

\subsection*{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Ecosystem Considerations}

Rockfish are an important component of the California Current ecosystem
along the US west coast, with its more than sixty five species filling
various niches in both soft and hard bottom habitats from the nearshore
to the continental slope, as well as near bottom and pelagic zones.
Pacific ocean perch are generally considered to be semi-demersal but,
there can at times, be a significant pelagic component to their
distribution.

Recruitment is one mechanism by which the ecosystem may directly impact
the population dynamics of Pacific ocean perch. The 1999 cohort for many
species of rockfish was large - sometimes significantly so. Long-term
averages suggesting that environmental conditions may influence the
spawning success and survival of larvae and juvenile rockfish. Pacific
ocean perch showed an above average recruitment deviation in 1999 and
2000. The specific pathways through which environmental conditions exert
influence on Pacific ocean perch dynamics are unclear; however, changes
in water temperature and currents, distribution of prey and predators,
and the amount and timing of upwelling are all possible linkages.
Changes in the environment may also result in changes in
length-at-maturity, fecundity, growth, and survival which can affect the
status of the stock and its susceptibility to fishing. Unfortunately,
there are few data available for Pacific ocean perch that provide
insights into these effects.

Fishing has effects on both the age structure of a population, as well
as the habitat with which the target species is associated. Fishing
often targets larger, older fish, and years of fishing mortality results
in a truncated age-structure when compared to unfished conditions.
Rockfish are often associated with habitats containing living structure
such as sponges and corals, and fishing may alter that habitat to a less
desirable state. This assessment provides a look at the effects of
fishing on age structure, and recent studies on essential fish habitat
are beginning to characterize important locations for rockfish
throughout their life history; however there is little current
information available to evaluate the specific effects of fishing on the
ecosystem issues specific to Pacific ocean perch.

\subsection*{Reference Points}\label{reference-points}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reference Points}

This stock assessment estimates that Pacific ocean perch are above the
biomass target. Due to the large 2008 year-class, an increasing trend in
spawning biomass was estimated in the base model. The estimated relative
biomass level in 2017 is 76.1\% (\textasciitilde{}95\% asymptotic
interval: \(\pm\) 53.8\%-98.4\%), corresponding to an unfished spawning
output of 5047 million eggs (\textasciitilde{}95\% asymptotic interval:
2259-7835 million eggs). Unfished age 3+ biomass was estimated to be
139810 mt in the base case model. The target spawning output based on
the biomass target (\(SB_{40\%}\)) is 2653.2 million eggs, which gives a
catch of 1748.2 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\) harvest
rate corresponding to \(SPR_{50\%}\) is 1764.8 mt.

\subsection*{Management Performance}\label{management-performance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Management Performance}

Exploitation rates on Pacific ocean perch exceeded MSY proxy target
harvest rates during the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in sharp declines in
the spawning output. Exploitation rates subsequently declined to rates
at or below the management target in the 1980s. Management restrictions
imposed in the 1990s further reduced exploitation rates. An overfished
declaration for Pacific ocean perch resulted in very low exploitation
rates since 2001 with the ACLs being set far below the OFL and ABC
values.

\subsection*{Research and Data Needs}\label{research-and-data-needs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Research and Data Needs}

There are many areas of research that could be improved to benefit the
understanding and assessment of Pacific ocean perch. Below, are issues
that are considered of the importance.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Natural mortality}: Uncertainty in natural mortality translates into uncertain estimates of status and sustainable fishing levels for Pacific ocean perch. The collection of additional age data, re-reading of older age samples, reading old age samples that are unread, and improved understanding of the life-history of Pacific ocean perch may reduce that uncertainty.

\item \textbf{Steepness}: The amount of stock resilience, steepness, dictates the rate at which a stock can rebuild from low stock sizes.  Improved understating regarding the steepness of US west coast Pacific ocean perch will reduce our uncertainty regarding current stock status.

\item \textbf{Basin-wide understanding of stock structure, biology, connectivity, and distribution:} This is a stock assessment for Pacific ocean perch off of the west coast of the US and does not consider data from British Columbia or Alaska. Further investigating and comparing the data and predictions from British Columbia and Alaska to determine if there are similarities with the US west coast observations would help to define the connectivity between Pacific ocean perch north and south of the US-Canada border.

\subsection{Basic Information}\label{basic-information}

Pacific ocean perch (\emph{Sebastes alutus}) are most abundant in the
Gulf of Alaska, and have been observed off of Japan, in the Bering Sea,
and south to Baja California, although they are sparse south of Oregon
and rare in southern California. While genetic studies have found three
populations of Pacific ocean perch off of British Columbia related to
unique geography and oceanic conditions (Seeb and Gunderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-seeb_genetic_1988}{1988}, Withler et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-withler_co-existing_2001}{2001}) with, notably, a
separate stock off of Vancouver Island, no significant genetic
differences have been found in the range covered by this assessment.
Pacific ocean perch show dimorphic growth, with females reaching a
slightly large size than males. Males and females are equally abundant
on rearing grounds at age 1.5.

The Pacific ocean perch population has been modeled as a single stock
off of the US west coast (essentially northern California to the
Canadian border, since Pacific ocean perch are seen extremely rarely in
central and southern California). Good recruitments show up in
size-composition data throughout all portions of this area, which
supports the single stock hypothesis. This assessment includes landings
and catch data for Pacific ocean perch from the states of Washington,
Oregon and California, along with records from foreign fisheries, the
At-sea hake fleet, and fishery-independent surveys.

Prior to 1966, the Pacific ocean perch resource off of the northern
portion of the US west coast was harvested almost entirely by Canadian
and United States vessels. Harvest was negligible prior to 1940, reached
1367 mt in 1950, 3243 mt in 1961 and 7635 mt in 1965. Catches increased
dramatically after 1965, with the introduction of large distant-water
fishing fleets from the Soviet Union and Japan. Both nations employed
large factory stern trawlers as their primary method for harvesting
Pacific ocean perch. Peak removals are estimated at 18883 mt in 1966 and
14591 mt in 1967. These numbers are based upon a re-analysis of the
foreign catch data (Rogers
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rogers_species_2003}{2003}), which focused on
deriving a more realistic species composition for catches previously
identified only as Pacific ocean perch. Catches declined rapidly
following these peak years, and Pacific ocean perch stocks were
considered to be severely depleted throughout the Oregon-Vancouver
Island region by 1969 (Gunderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_population_1977}{1977}, Gunderson et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_status_1977}{1977}). Landed harvest
averaged 1377 mt over the period 1977-94. Landings have continued to
decline since 1994, primarily due to more restrictive management (Table
\ref{tab:Comm_Catch} and Figure \ref{fig:Catch}).

Prior to 1977, Pacific ocean perch in the northeast Pacific were managed
by the Canadian Government in its waters and by the individual states in
waters off of the United States. With implementation of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA) in 1977, US territorial
waters were extended to 200 miles from shore, and primary responsibility
for management of the groundfish stocks off Washington, Oregon and
California shifted from the states to the Pacific Fishery Management
Council (PFMC) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). At that
time, however, a Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the West Coast
groundfish stocks had not yet been approved. In the interim, the state
agencies worked with the PFMC to address conservation issues. In 1981,
the PFMC adopted a management strategy to rebuild the depleted Pacific
ocean perch stocks to levels that would produce Maximum Sustainable
Yield (MSY) within 20 years. On the basis of cohort analysis (Gunderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_results_1978}{1978}), the PFMC set
Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) levels at 600 mt for the US portion of
the Vancouver INPFC area and 950 mt for the Columbia INPFC area. To
implement this strategy, the states of Oregon and Washington each
established landing limits for Pacific ocean perch. Trawl trip limits of
various forms remained in effect through 2016 (Table \ref{tab:Regs}).

Age estimates for Pacific ocean perch prior to the 1980s were made via
surface ageing of otoliths, which misses the very tight annuli at the
edge of the otolith once the fish reaches near maximum size. Ages are
highly biased by around age 10-12, and maximum age was estimated to be
in the 20s, which lead to an overestimate of the natural mortality rate
and the productivity of the stock. Using break and burn methods, Pacific
ocean perch have been aged to over 100 years. Research surveys have been
used to provide fishery-independent information about the abundance,
distribution, and biological characteristics of Pacific ocean perch. A
coast-wide survey of the rockfish resource was conducted in 1977
(Gunderson and Sample
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_distribution_1980}{1980}) and was
repeated every three years through 2004 (referred to as the `Triennial
survey'). The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) coordinated a
cooperative research survey of the Pacific ocean perch stocks off
Washington and Oregon with the Washington Department of Fisheries (WDFW)
and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) in March-May 1979
(Wilkins and Golden
\protect\hyperlink{ref-wilkins_condition_1983}{1983}). This survey was
repeated in 1985 (referred to as the Pacific ocean perch survey). Two
slope surveys have been conducted off the West Coast in recent years,
one using the research vessel Miller Freeman, which ended in 2001
(referred to as the `AFSC slope survey'), and another ongoing
cooperative survey using commercial fishing vessels which began in 1998
as a DTS (Dover sole, thornyhead and sablefish) survey and was expanded
to other groundfish in 1999 (referred to as the `NWFSC slope survey').
In 2003, this survey was expanded spatially to include the shelf. This
last survey, conducted by the NWFSC, continues to cover depths from
30-700 fathoms (55-1280 meters) on an annual basis (referred to as the
`NWFSC shelf-slope survey').

\subsection{Summary of Management
History}\label{summary-of-management-history}

The landings of Pacific ocean perch have been historically governed by
harvest guidelines and trip limits, while recently management has
imposed total catch harvest limits in the form of overfishing limits
(OFLs), acceptable biological catches (ABCs), and annual catch limits
(ACLs). A trawl rationalization program, consisting of an individual
fishing quota (IFQ) catch shares system was implemented in 2011 for the
limited entry trawl fleet targeting non-whiting groundfish, including
Pacific ocean perch, and the trawl fleet targeting and delivering
whiting to shore-based processors. The limited entry at-sea trawl
sectors (motherships and catch-processors) that target whiting and
process at-sea are managed in a system of harvest cooperatives.

Limits on Pacific ocean perch were first established in 1983 (Table
\ref{tab:Regs}). These were implemented as area closures, trip limits,
and cumulative landing limits. In 1999, Pacific ocean perch was declared
overfished with the assessment estimating the spawning output below the
management limit (25\% of virgin biomass). In reaction to the overfished
deceleration, harvest limits were reduced relative to previous years and
a rebuilding plan was implemented in 2001 with recent ACLs being set
well below the estimated OFLs(Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform_tables}).

\subsection{Fisheries off Canada and
Alaska}\label{fisheries-off-canada-and-alaska}

Pacific ocean perch can be found in waters off the US west coast and
northward through Alaskan waters. In contrast the Pacific ocean perch
stock off the US west coast, each assessed portion of the stock in
Canada and Alaskan waters have historically been estimated to be above
management targets. The subset of the stock off the US west coast
represents the tail of the species distribution with little to no
Pacific ocean perch being encountered south of northern California. The
most recent updated assessments for the Bering Sea and the Gulf of
Alaska stocks determined that neither stock are in an overfished state
and recommended and acceptable biological catch of 43,723 mt and 23,918
mt, respectively, for 2017.

In Canadian waters Pacific ocean perch has the largest single-species
quota, accounting for approximately 25\% of all rockfish landings by
weight in the bottom trawl fleet. The Canadian Pacific ocean perch stock
is broken into three separate areas that are individually assessed. The
status of the stock within each area are above Canadian management
targets.

\section{Data}\label{data}

Data used in the Pacific ocean perch assessment are summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:data_plot}. A description of each data source is provided
below.

\subsection{Fishery-Independent Data:}\label{fishery-independent-data}

\subsubsection{Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) shelf-slope
survey}\label{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}

The NWFSC shelf-slope survey is based on a random-grid design; covering
the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m (Bradburn et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bradburn_2003_2011}{2011}). This design uses four
chartered industry vessels in most years, assigned to a roughly equal
number of randomly selected grid cells. The survey, which has been
conducted from late-May to early-October each year, is divided into two
2-vessel passes of the coast, which are executed from north to south.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in
catchability as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively
small number (approximately 700) of cells from a very large population
of possible cells (greater than 11,000) distributed from the Mexican to
the Canadian border.

The data from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey was analyzed using a
spatio-temporal delta-model (Thorson et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_geostatistical_2015}{2015}), implemented
as an R package VAST (Thorson and Barnett
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_comparing_2017}{2017}) and publicly
available online (\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST}). Spatial
and spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter
probability and positive catch rates, a logit-link for encounter
probability, and a log-link for positive catch rates. Vessel-year
effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in
the database, to account for the random selection of commercial vessels
used during sampling (Helser et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-helser_generalized_2004}{2004}, Thorson and Ward
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_accounting_2014}{2014})). Spatial
variation was approximated using 1000 knots, and use the bias-correction
algorithm (Thorson and Kristensen
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_implementing_2016}{2016}) in Template
Model Builder (Kristensen et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kristensen_tmb:_2016}{2016}). Further details
regarding model structure are available in the user manual
(\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/blob/master/examples/VAST_user_manual.pdf}).

The smallest Pacific ocean perch tend to occur in the shallower depths
(\textless{} 200 m) with only larger individuals occurring at depths
deeper than 300 m. Data collected by the NWFSC shelf-slope survey
between depths of 55 - 549 m and north of \(42^\circ\) and south of
\(49^\circ\) were stratified to generate an index of abundance from
2003-2016. The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table
\ref{tab:Index_Summary}. The lognormal distribution with random
strata-year and vessel effects had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the
final model. The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed
distribution (Figure \ref{fig:nw_qq}). The indices for the NWFSC
shelf-slope survey show a tentative decline in the population between
2003 and 2009, with an increasing trend in biomass between the 2009 and
2016 median point estimates.

Length and conditional age-at-length compositions were expanded based
upon the stratification. The number of tows with length data ranged from
33 in 2006 to 69 in 2015 (Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Lengths}) where ages
were collected for Pacific ocean perch in nearly every tow (Table
\ref{tab:NWcombo_Ages}). The expanded length frequencies from this
survey show an increase in small fish starting in 2010 (Figure
\ref{fig:nw_Length}). The age frequencies provide clear evidence of
large year-classes moving through the population from the 1999, 2000,
and 2008 recruitment; with early indications of a large 2013 recruitment
(Figure \ref{fig:nw_Age}).

The effective sample sizes for length and marginal age composition data
for all fishery-independent surveys were calculated according to Stewart
\& Hamel (\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart_bootstrapping_2014}{2014})
which determined that the approximate realized sample size for
shelf/slope rockfish species was 2.43*\(N_{\text{tow}}\). The effective
sample size of conditional-age-at-length data was set at the number of
fish at each length by year.

\subsubsection{Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) slope
survey}\label{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-slope-survey}

The NWFSC slope survey covered waters throughout the summer from 183 m
to 1280 m north of \(34^\circ 30^\prime\) S, which is near Point
Conception between 1999 and 2002. Tows conducted between the depths of
183 and 549 m were used to create an index of abundance using a bayesian
delta-GLMM and the VAST delta-GLMM models. The estimated index of
abundance is show in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}. Based on the
diagnostics the bayesian delta-GLMM, which does not account for spatial
effects, gamma distribution with year-vessel random effects was selected
as the final model. The Q-Q plot does not show any extreme departures
from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:nw_slope_qq}). The trend
of abundance across the four surveys years was generally flat with high
estimated annual variance.

Length and age compositions were available for 2001 and 2002 and were
expanded based upon the survey stratification (Tables
\ref{tab:NWslope_Lengths} and \ref{tab:NWslope_Ages}). The expanded
length frequencies from this survey shows that primarily only large fish
were captured both years (Figure \ref{fig:nw_slope_Length}). The
majority of fish observed by this survey were aged at greater than 10
years (Figure \ref{fig:nw_slope_Age}).

The effective sample sizes for length and marginal age composition data
were calculated according to Stewart \& Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart_bootstrapping_2014}{2014}) described in
Section
\ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}.

\subsubsection{Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) slope
survey}\label{alaska-fisheries-science-center-afsc-slope-survey}

The AFSC slope survey operated during autumn (October-November) aboard
the R/V Miller Freeman. Partial survey coverage of the US west coast
occurred during 1988-96 and complete coverage (north of
\(34^\circ 30^\prime\) S) during 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Only the
four years of consistent and complete surveys plus 1996, which surveyed
north of \(43^\circ\) N latitude to the US-Canada border, were used in
this assessment. The number of tows with length data ranged from 19 in
2000 to 48 in 1996 (Table \ref{tab:AFSC_Lengths}). Because a large
number of positive tows occurred in 1996, it was decided to include that
year, which surveyed from \(43^\circ\) N latitude to the US-Canada
border. Therefore, only tows from \(43^\circ\) N latitude to the
US-Canada border were used.

An index of abundance was estimated based on the data using the VAST
delta-GLMM model. The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table
\ref{tab:Index_Summary}. The lognormal distribution with random
strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model. The
Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution
(Figure \ref{fig:afsc_qq}). The trend in the indices was generally flat
over time.

Length compositions were available for each year the survey was
conducted. No age data were available from this survey. The expanded
length frequencies from this survey were generally of larger fish (
\textgreater{} 30 cm), expect for 1997 where the highest frequency of
fish were between 20 and 30 cm for both females and males (Figure
\ref{fig:afsc_Length}).

The effective sample sizes for length and marginal age composition data
were calculated according to Stewart \& Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart_bootstrapping_2014}{2014}) described in
Section
\ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}.

\subsubsection{Triennial Bottom Trawl
Survey}\label{triennial-bottom-trawl-survey}

The Triennial survey was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and spanned
the time-frame from 1977-2004. The survey's design and sampling methods
are most recently described in (Weinberg et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-weinberg_estimation_2002}{2002}). Its basic
design was a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for
tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design has
changed slightly over the period of time. In general, all of the surveys
were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the 1977 survey was
conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980
through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey
spanned from mid-July through early October; the 1995 survey was
conducted from early June to late August; the 1998 survey ran from early
June through early August; and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted
in May-July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls
shallower than 91 m. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the
West Coast south to \(36.8^\circ\) N latitude and a depth range of
55-366 meters. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range
but extended the southern range to \(34.5^\circ\) N (near Point
Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range
55-500 meters and surveyed south to \(34.5^\circ\) N. In the final year
of the Triennial series (2004), the NWFSC's Fishery Resource and
Monitoring division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very
similar protocols as the AFSC.

Given the different depths surveyed during 1977, the data from that year
were not included in this assessment. Water hauls (Zimmermann et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zimmermann_influence_2003}{2003}) and tows
located in Canadian waters were also excluded from the analysis of this
survey. The data was examined for varying distribution of length and/or
ages of fish based upon the shift in survey timing and little evidence
was found of ontogenetic shifts in Pacific ocean perch during the summer
months. Pacific ocean perch are rarely encountered south of \(40^\circ\)
where the change in southern range of the survey would have no impact on
data collected regarding Pacific ocean perch. Given these factors the
Triennial survey was analyzed as a single time-series, a departure from
how the previous assessment which split the time-series into and an
early (1980-1992) and a late period (1995-2004).

An index of abundance was estimated based on the data using the VAST
delta-GLMM model. The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table
\ref{tab:Index_Summary}. The lognormal distribution with random
strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model. The
Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution
(Figure \ref{fig:tri_qq}). The index shows a decline in abundance in the
early years of the time-series and abundance remaining flat for the
latter years.

Length and age compositions were expanded based upon the stratification.
The number of tows with length data ranged from 17 in 1986 to 81 in 1998
(Table \ref{tab:TriennialLengths}). Ages were read using surface reading
methods until 1989 when the break-and-burn method replaced surface reads
as the best method to age Pacific ocean perch. Unfortunately, surface
reading of Pacific ocean perch otoliths results in significant
underestimates of age. Due to this, these otoliths were excluded from
analysis. The available ages from the Triennial survey and the number of
tows where otoliths were collected are shown in Table
\ref{tab:Triennial_Ages}. The expanded length frequencies from this
survey show an increase in small fish starting in 1995 (Figure
\ref{fig:Tri_Length}). The age frequencies provide clear evidence of
large year-classes moving through the population from the 1999 and 2000
recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:Tri_Age}).

The effective sample sizes for length and marginal age composition data
were calculated according to Stewart \& Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart_bootstrapping_2014}{2014}) described in
Section
\ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}.

\subsubsection{Pacific ocean perch
Survey}\label{pacific-ocean-perch-survey}

A survey designed to sample Pacific ocean perch was conducted in 1979
and again in 1985 (for a detailed description see (Ianelli et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ianelli_status_1992}{1992})). An index of
abundance was estimated based on the data using the VAST delta-GLMM
model. The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table
\ref{tab:Index_Summary}. The lognormal distribution with random
strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model. The
Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution
(Figure \ref{fig:pop_qq}). The index shows a clear decline in abundance
between the two survey years.

Length and age compositions were expanded based on the stratification.
The survey had 125 and 126 Pacific ocean perch tows (Table
\ref{tab:POP_Lengths}) and ages were only available in 1985 due to
surface reads for the 1979 data (Table \ref{tab:POP_Ages}). The length
frequencies for both years are highest between the 30-45 cm range
(Figure \ref{fig:POP_Length}) with ages in 1985 having a large number of
fish age 40 and greater (Figure \ref{fig:POP_Age}).

The effective sample sizes for length and marginal age composition data
were calculated according to Stewart \& Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart_bootstrapping_2014}{2014}) described in
Section
\ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}.

\subsection{Fishery-Dependent Data}\label{fishery-dependent-data}

\subsubsection{Commercial Fishery
Landings}\label{commercial-fishery-landings}

\textbf{Washington}

Historical commercial fishery landings of Pacific ocean perch from
Washington for the years 1908-2016 were obtained from Theresa Tsou
(WDFW) and Phillip Weyland (WDFW). This assessment is the first Pacific
ocean perch assessment to include a state provide historical catch
reconstruction and hence, the historical catches for Washington differ
from those used in the 2011 assessment. Due to recent corrections to the
landings of Pacific ocean perch based upon market categories (1981-2016)
were obtained directly from Washington state rather than from Pacific
Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN).

\textbf{Oregon}

Historical commercial fishery landings of Pacific ocean perch from
Oregon for the years 1892-1986 were obtained from Alison Dauble (ODFW).
A description of the methods can be found in Karnowski et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-karnowski_historical_2014}{2014}). Recent
landings (1987-2016) were obtained from PacFIN retrieval dated May 2,
2017, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon;
www.psmfc.org). The catch data in from the POP and POP2 categories
contained within PacFIN for Pacific ocean perch were used for this
assessment. Additional catches from 1987-1999 for Pacific ocean perch
under the UROCK category not yet available in PacFIN were received
directly from the state and combined with the catch data available for
that period within PacFIN (Patrick Mirrick, personal communication,
ODFW).

\textbf{California}

Historical commercial fishery landings of Pacific ocean perch were
obtained directly from John Field at the SWFSC due to database issues
for the historical period for the California Cooperative Groundfish
Survey, also known as CALCOM (128.114.3.187) for the years 1916-1980. A
description of the historical reconstruction methods can be found in
(Ralston et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ralston_documentation_2010}{2010}). Recent
landings (1981-2016) were obtained from PacFIN retrieval dated May 2,
2017, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon;
www.psmfc.org).

\textbf{At-Sea Hake Fishery}

Catches of Pacific ocean perch are monitored aboard the vessel by
observers in the At-Sea hake Observer program (ASHOP) and were available
for the years of 1975-2016. Observers use a spatial sample design, based
on weight, to randomly choose a portion of the haul to sample for
species composition. For the last decade, this is typically 30-50\% of
the total weight. The total weight of the sample is determined by all
catch passing over a flow scale. All species other than hake are removed
and weighed by species on a motion compensated flatbed scale. Observers
record the weights of all non-hake species. Non-hake species total
weights are expanded in the database by using the proportion of the haul
sampled to the total weight of the haul. The catches of non-hake species
in unsampled hauls is determined using bycatch rates determined from
sampled hauls. Since 2001, more than 97\% of the hauls have been
observed and sampled.

\textbf{Foreign Catches}

From the 1960s through the early 1970s, foreign trawling enterprises
harvested considerable amounts of rockfish off Washington and Oregon,
and along with the domestic trawling fleet, landed large quantities of
Pacific ocean perch. Foreign catches of individual species were
estimated by Rogers (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rogers_species_2003}{2003})
and attributed to INPFC areas for the years of 1966-1976 for Pacific
ocean perch. The foreign catches were combined across areas for a
coastwide removal total.

\subsubsection{Discards}\label{discards}

Data on discards of Pacific ocean perch are available from two different
data sources. The earliest source is referred to as the Pikitch data and
comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl
discards from 1985-1987 (Pikitch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pikitch_evaluation_1988}{1988}). The northern and
southern boundaries of the study were \(48^\circ 42^\prime\) N latitude
and \(42^\circ 60^\prime\) N. latitude respectively, which is primarily
within the Columbia INPFC area (Pikitch et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pikitch_evaluation_1988}{1988} , Rogers and
Pikitch \protect\hyperlink{ref-rogers_numerical_1992}{1992}).
Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using
bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers of normal fishing
operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total
weight of the catch by tow and recorded the weight of species retained
and discarded in the sample. Results of the Pikitch data were obtained
from John Wallace (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) in the form of
ratios of discard weight to retained weight of Pacific ocean perch and
sex-specific length frequencies. Discard estimates are shown in Table
\ref{tab:Discard}.

The second source is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program
(WCGOP). This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording
discard observations since 2003. Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the
discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) of Pacific ocean perch
from WCGOP. Since 2011, when the trawl rationalization program was
implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100\% for all
the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates
declined compared to pre-2011 rates. Discard rates were obtained for
both the catch-share and the non-catch share sector for Pacific ocean
perch. A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates
based on the commercial landings by each sector. Coefficient of
variations were calculated by bootstrapping vessels within ports because
the observer program randomly chooses vessels within ports to be
observed in the non-catch shares sectors. Discard length composition for
the trawl fleet varied by year, with larger fish being discarded prior
to 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:WCGOP_discard}).

\subsubsection{Historical Commercial Catch-per-unit
effort}\label{historical-commercial-catch-per-unit-effort}

Data on catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in mt/hr from the domestic fishery
were combined for the INPFC Vancouver and Columbia areas (Table
\ref{tab:CPUE_Summary}, from Gunderson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_population_1977}{1977})). Although
these data reflect catch rates for the US fleet, the highest catch rates
coincided with the beginning of removals by the foreign fleet. This
suggest that, barring unaccounted changes in fishing efficiency during
this period, the level of abundance was high at that time. A CV of 0.40
was used in this assessment to be consistent with the CV observed in the
survey data.

\subsubsection{Fishery Length And Age
Data}\label{fishery-length-and-age-data}

Biological data from commercial fisheries that caught Pacific ocean
perch were extracted from PacFIN on May 4, 2017. Lengths taken during
port sampling in Oregon and Washington were used to calculate length and
age compositions. There were no biological data from California for
Pacific ocean perch available within PacFIN. The overwhelming majority
of these data were collected from the mid-water and bottom trawl gear,
but additional biological data were collected from non-trawl gear which
was grouped together with trawl gear data. Tables \ref{tab:Comm_Lengths}
and \ref{tab:Comm_Ages} show the number of trips and fish sampled, along
with the calculated sample sizes. Length and age data were acquired at
the trip level, and then aggregated to the state level. The sample sizes
were calculated via the Stewart Method (Ian Stewart, personal
communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

The fishery fleet observed Pacific ocean perch that were generally
greater than 30 cm across all years of available data (Figure
\textbackslash{}ref\{fig:Comm\_Length). The fishery fleet age data has
clear trends of a large cohort moving through the population (Figure
\ref{fig:Comm_Age}). Lengths and ages were also available for the At-sea
hake fishery and are shown in Figures \ref{fig:ASHOP_Length} and
\ref{fig:ASHOP_Age}.

\subsection{Biological Data}\label{biological-data}

\subsubsection{Natural mortality}\label{natural-mortality}

Historic Pacific ocean perch ages determined using scales and surface
reading methods of otoliths, resulted in estimates of natural mortality
(\(M\)) of between 0.10 and 0.20yr\textsuperscript{-1} with a longevity
less than 30 years(Gunderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_population_1977}{1977}). Based on
break-and-burn method of age determination using otoliths, the maximum
age of Pacific ocean perch was revised to be 90 years (Chilton and
Beamish \protect\hyperlink{ref-chilton_age_1982}{1982}). The updated
understanding concerning Pacific ocean perch longevity reduced the
estimate of natural mortality based on Hoenig's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoenig_empirical_1983}{1983}) relationship to
0.059yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The previous assessment applied a prior
distribution on natural mortality based upon multiple life history
correlates (including Hoenig's method, Gunderson gonadosomatic index
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_trade-off_1997}{1997}), and McCoy and
Gillooly's (\protect\hyperlink{ref-mccoy_predicting_2008}{2008})
theoretical relationship) developed separately for female and male
Pacific ocean perch.

Hamel (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamel_method_2015}{2015}) developed a
method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the natural
mortality rate \(M\) to other life-history parameters such as longevity,
size, growth rate and reproductive effort, to provide a prior on \(M\).
In that same issue of ICESJMS, Then et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015}), provided an
updated data set of estimates of \(M\) and related life history
parameters across a large number of fish species, from which to develop
an \(M\) estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by
recommending \(M\) estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an
updated Hoenig non-linear least squares (nls) estimator
\(M=4.899A_max^(-.916)\). The approach of basing \(M\) priors on maximum
age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish
assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating
\(M\) to \(A_{\text{max}}\), Then et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015}) did not
consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space,
one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation
and process error associated with the observed relationship of \(M\) to
\(A_{\text{max}}\). Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models
under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data
used in Then et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015})
by fitting the one-parameter \(A_{\text{max}}\) model under a log-log
transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the
transformed space (Hamel
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamel_method_2015}{2015})), the point estimate
for \(M\) is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a
lognormal with mean \(ln(\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}})\) and SE = 0.438.
Using a maximum age of 100 the point estimate and median of the prior is
0.054. The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all
West Coast data sources. The oldest aged rockfish was 120 years,
captured by the commercial fishery in 2007. However, age data are
subject to ageing error which could impact this estimate of longevity.
The selection of 100 years was based on the range of other ages
available with had multiple observations of fish between 90 and 102
years of age.

\subsubsection{Sex ratio, maturation, and
fecundity}\label{sex-ratio-maturation-and-fecundity}

Examining all biological data sources, the sex ratio of young fish are
within 5\% of 1:1 by length until larger sizes which are dominated by
females who reach a larger maximum size relative to males (Figure
\ref{fig:sexratio}), with the sex ratio being approximately equal across
ages (Figure \ref{fig:sexratio_Age}), and hence this assessment the sex
ratio at birth was assumed to be 1:1. This assessment assumed a logistic
maturity-at-length curve based on analysis of 537 fish maturity samples
collected from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey. This is revised from the
previous assessment which assumed maturity-at-age based on the work of
Hannah and Parker
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hannah_age-modulated_2007}{2007}). Additionally,
the new maturity-at-length curve is based on the estimate of functional
maturity, an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing
oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in
the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (Melissa Head,
personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA). The 50\% size-at-maturity was
estimated at 32.1 cm with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish
(Figure \ref{fig:mat}). Comparison between the maturity-at-age used in
the previous assessment and the updated functional maturity-at-length is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:mat_compare}.

The fecundity-at-age has also been updated from the previous assessment
based on new research. Dick
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dick_meta-analysis_2017}{2017}) estimated new
fecundity relationships for select West Coast stocks where fecundity for
Pacific ocean perch was estimated equal to
8.66e-10\(L\)\textsuperscript{4.98} in millions of eggs. Spawning output
at length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.

\subsubsection{Length-weight
relationship}\label{length-weight-relationship}

The length-weight relationship for Pacific ocean perch was estimated
outside the model using all biological data available from
fishery-dependent and -independent data sources where the female
weight-at-length in grams was estimated at
1.044e-05\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.09} and males at
1.05e-05\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.08} where \(L\) is length in cm (Figures
\ref{fig:Wt_len} and \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).

\subsubsection{Growth (length-at-age)}\label{growth-length-at-age}

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female Pacific ocean perch
using data collected from both fishery-dependent and -independent data
sources that were collected from 1981-2016. Figure \ref{fig:Len_Age}
shows the lengths and ages for all years and all data as well as
predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than
males and sex specific growth parameters were estimated at the following
values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 42.32; $k$ = 0.169; $t_0$ = -1.466

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 39.03; $k$ = 0.212; $t_0$ = -1.02

\end{centering}

These values were used as starting parameter values within the model
prior to estimating each parameter for male and female Pacific ocean
perch.

\subsubsection{Ageing Precision And
Bias}\label{ageing-precision-and-bias}

Uncertainty surrounding the ageing error process for Pacific ocean perch
was incorporated by estimating ageing error by age. Age-composition data
used in the model were from break-and-burn otolith reads aged by the
Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon. Break-and-burn
double reads of more than 1500 otoliths were provided by the CAP lab. An
ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a
computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error
(Punt et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-punt_quantifying_2008}{2008}), and
using release 1.0.0 of the R package nwfscAgeingError (Thorson et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorson_nwfscageingerror:_2012}{2012}) for input
and output diagnostics, publicly available at:
\url{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError}. A non-linear
standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in
the age of older fish (Table \ref{tab:Age_Error} and Figure
\ref{fig:Age_Error}).

\subsection{History Of Modeling Approaches Used For This
Stock}\label{history-of-modeling-approaches-used-for-this-stock}

\subsubsection{Previous Assessments}\label{previous-assessments}

The status of Pacific ocean perch off British Columbia, Washington, and
Oregon have been periodically assessed since the intensive exploitation
that occurred in the 1960s. Concerns regarding Pacific ocean perch
status off the coast the US west coast were raised in the late 1970s
(Gunderson \protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_results_1978}{1978},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gunderson_updated_1981}{1981}) and in 1981 the
PFMC adopted a 20-year plan to rebuild the stock.

The 1992 assessment determined that Pacific ocean perch remained at low
levels relative to the population size in 1960 (Ianelli et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ianelli_status_1992}{1992}) and recommended
additional harvest restrictions to allow for stock rebuilding. The 1998
assessment (Ianelli and Zimmermann
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ianelli_status_1998}{1998}) estimated that the
stock was 13\% of the unfished level, leading the National Marine
Fishery Service (NMFS) to declare the stock overfished in 1999. A formal
rebuilding plan was implemented in 2001. The rebuilding plan reduced the
SPR harvest rate used to determine catches to 0.864 (in contrast to the
default harvest rate of 0.50). The last full assessment of Pacific ocean
perch was conducted in 2011 (Hamel and Ono
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hamel_stock_2011}{2011}) which concluded that the
stock was still well below the target biomass of \(40\%SB_{0}\)
estimating the relative stock status at 19.1\%.

\subsubsection{Previous Assessment
Recommendations}\label{previous-assessment-recommendations}

Recommendation: Considering trans-boundary stock effects should be
pursued. In particular the consequences of having spawning contributions
from external stock components should be evaluated relative to the
steepness estimates obtained in the present assessment.

\emph{STAT response: The STAT team agrees that this should be an ongoing
area of research and collaboration between the US and Canada. This
assessment presents a sensitivity where the inclusion of Canadian data
are included within the model.}

Recommendation: The benefits of adopting the complex model used this
year should be evaluated relative to simpler assumptions and models.
While the transition from the simpler old model to Stock Synthesis was
shown to be similar for the historical period, the depletion estimates
in the most recent years were different enough to warrant further
investigation.

\emph{STAT response: This assessment was performed in Stock Synthesis,
an integrated model, which can be modified to either simple or complex
structural forms based upon the available data and the processes being
modeled. There were not addtional explorations of alternative modeling
platforms.}

Recommendation: Discard estimates from observer programs should be
presented, reviewed (similar to the catch reconstructions), and be made
available to the assessment process.

\emph{STAT response: This assessment uses discard rates and discard
lengths collected by the WCGOP from 2003-2015.}

Recommendation: The ability to allow different ``plus groups'' for
specific data types should be evaluated (and implemented in Stock
Synthesis). For example, this would provide the ability to use the
biased surface-aged data in an appropriate way.

\emph{STAT response: Additional research needs to completed which
evaluates the amount of bias and imprecision in surface-read ages.
Evaluating available surface-read ages within the PacFIN database fish
of lengths between 23-44 cm can be aged at 10 years old. This large
range of lengths at the same age indicates considerable bias in ages for
fish surface-read younger aged fish.}

Recommendation: Historical catch reconstruction estimates should be
formally reviewed prior to being used in assessments and should be
coordinated so that interactions between stocks are appropriately
treated. The relative reliability of the catch estimates over time could
provide an axis of uncertainty in future assessments.

\emph{STAT response: California and Oregon have undergone extensive work
to create historical catch reconstructions. This is the first assessment
for Pacific ocean perch which includes a Washington historical catch
reconstruction. The data used in this assessment represent Washington
state's current best estimate for historical catches. Both California
and Washington are conducting research to estimate uncertainty surround
historical catches which could be used to propegate uncertainty within
the assessment.}

\section{Assessment}\label{assessment}

\subsection{General Model Specifications and
Assumptions}\label{general-model-specifications-and-assumptions}

Stock Synthesis v3.30.03.05 was used to estimate the parameters in the
model. R4SS, revision 1.27.0, along with R version 3.3.2 were used to
investigate and plot model fits. A summary of the data sources used in
the model (details discussed above) is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:data_plot}.

Stock Synthesis has many options when setting up a model and the
assessment model for Pacific ocean perch was set up in the following
manner.

\subsubsection{Changes between the 2011 assessment model and current
model}\label{changes-between-the-2011-assessment-model-and-current-model}

The current model for Pacific ocean perch has many made many similar
assumptions to the 2011 assessment but differs in some key ways. This
assessment disaggregated the fleets into a trawl/other gear, At-sea
hake, historical foreign fleet, and research fleets. The previous
assessment implemented a single fleet where removal from all sources
were aggregated together. The separating of fleets applied in this
assessment allowed for differing assumptions regarding current and
historical discarding practices. Although there are no compositional
data available from the foreign fleet, it is assumed that very little
discarding to no discarding of fish occurred. Additionally, the At-sea
hake fishery removals are represent both discarded and retained fish and
hence an additional discard rate would not be appropriate. Similar logic
was applied in regard to survey removals.

The historical landings used in the model differs from those used in
2011. The assessment includes the first state provided historical
reconstruction landings for Washington state. The historical
reconstruction has removals starting in 1916 and have larger removals in
the 1940s relative to those used in 2011 (Figure
\ref{fig:Catch_Compare}). Given the increase in historical removals
prior to 1940, the 2011 model starting year, the starting year for
modeling the stock was revised to 1918, the first year Pacific ocean
perch landings exceeded 1 mt. Explorations were conducted relative to
the model starting year and no differences were found between the 1918
start year compared to starting the model in 1892, the first record of
Pacific ocean perch landings between California, Oregon, and Washington
catch data.

Selectivity in this model is assumed to be length-based and is modeled
using double-normal for all fleets, expect the Pacific ocean perch
survey which retained the previous assessment assumption of logistic
selectivity. The previous assessment mirrored selectivity among the
Pacific ocean perch and both slope surveys (AFSC and NWFSC). This
assessment allows for survey specific selectivity.

All fishery-independent indices have been reevaluated for this
assessment using a spatial-temporal delta generalized linear mixed model
(VAST delta-GLMM) which is updated approach from that used 2011 which
did not incorporate spatial effects. An additional update to the
treatment of survey data was the decision to use the Triennial survey as
a single time-series ranging from 1980-2004. The previous assessment
opted to split this survey into an early and a late index of abundance
based upon the change in southern sampling and a shift in survey timing.
Northern California is considered to be the southern end of Pacific
ocean perch West Coast distribution with rare encounters in central or
southern California waters. The biological data from the Triennial
survey showed no discernible ontogenetic shifts in Pacific ocean perch
during the early or late period of summer samples. Based upon these
investigations, the Triennial survey was retained as a single index of
abundance.

Maturity and fecundity were updated for this assessment based upon new
research. Fecundity for Pacific ocean perch used in this assessment was
base on a reevaluation of the fecundity of West Coast rockfish by Dick
et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-dick_meta-analysis_2017}{2017}), updating
the previous fecundity estimates used in the 2011 assessment (Dick
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dick_modeling_2009}{2009}) (Figure
\ref{fig:fecundity}). Maturity in this assessment was based on
examination of 537 fish samples which were used to estimate functional
maturity, an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing
oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in
the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (Melissa Head,
personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA). The updated maturity curve was
based on maturity-at-length where the previous estimates used in 2011
were based on maturity-at-age (Figure \ref{fig:mat_compare}).

In this assessment, the beta prior developed from a meta-analysis of
West Coast groundfish was updated to the 2017 value (J. Thorson, pers
comm, NWFSC, NOAA) in preliminary models, with steepness fixed at an
alternative value in the final base model. Additionally, the prior for
natural mortality was updated based on analysis conducted by Owen Hamel
(personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA), where female and male natural
mortality fixed at the prior median.

\subsubsection{Summary of Fleets and
Areas}\label{summary-of-fleets-and-areas}

Pacific ocean perch are most frequently observed in Oregon and
Washington waters in survey and fishery observations. Multiple fisheries
encounter Pacific ocean perch. Trawl, fixed gear, and the At-sea
(mid-water) hake fisheries account for the majority of the current
Pacific ocean perch landings.

The majority of removals of Pacific ocean perch were observed by the
trawl gears with fixed gear accounting for a small fraction of the
catches available within PacFIN. Trawl and fixed gears were combined
into a coast-wide fleet. For the period from 1918 to the early 1990s,
prior to the introduction of trip limits for rockfish, limited
discarding of Pacific ocean perch was assumed. Observations of Pacific
ocean perch in the Pikitch et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-pikitch_evaluation_1988}{1988}) data (1986-1987)
allowed for a formal analysis of discard rates which were applied to the
historical period of the fishery. Foreign trawl catches (1966-1976) were
modeled as a single fleet. The At-sea hake fishery operates as a
mid-water fishery targeting Pacific whiting but encounters Pacific ocean
perch as a bycatch species. This fleet was also modeled as a single
fleet.

\subsubsection{Other Specifications}\label{other-specifications}

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table
\ref{tab:Model_setup}. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model
starting in 1918 with an accumulated age group at 60 years. Growth was
estimated and natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior.
The lengths in the population were tracked by 1 cm intervals and the
length data were binned into 1 cm intervals. A curvilinear ageing
imprecision relationship was estimated and used to model ageing error.
Fecundity-at-length was fixed at the values from Dick et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dick_meta-analysis_2017}{2017}) for Pacific
ocean perch and spawning output was defined in millions of eggs.

Age data were available for the commercial and At-sea hake fishery, as
well as the Triennial, the Pacific ocean perch, the NWFSC slope, and the
NWFSC shelf-slope surveys. The ages from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey
and were entered into the model as conditional age-at-length. The
assessment used length-frequencies collected by the fishery fleet, the
At-sea hake fishery, the Triennial, Pacific ocean perch, AFSC slope,
NWFSC slope, and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys.

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an
assumption that likely affects model uncertainty. It was decided to
estimate recruitment deviations from 1900-2014 to appropriately quantify
uncertainty. The earliest length-composition data occur in 1966 and the
earliest age data were in 1981. The most informed years for estimating
recruitment deviations were from about the mid-1970s to about 2011. The
period from 1900-1974 was fit using an early series with little or no
bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from
1975-2014 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment, and
2015 onward was fit using forecast recruitment deviates with little bias
adjustment. Methot and Taylor
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-methot_adjusting_2011}{2011}) summarize the
reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the
information available to estimate the deviates. The standard deviation
of recruitment variability was assumed to be 0.70.

The recommended selectivity type in Stock Synthesis is the double normal
and was used in this assessment for the all fleets, except the Pacific
ocean perch survey which was assumed logistic based on the length
composition data. Changes in retention curves were estimated for the
commercial fishery fleet.

Time blocks for the fishery fleet are provided in Table
\ref{tab:Model_setup}. Fishery retention has changed over the modeled
period due to management changes. The time block on the retention curves
for the fishery were set from 1918-1991, 1992-2001, 2002-2007, 2008,
2009-2010, 2011-2016 based on available discarding data and changes in
trip limits that likely resulted in changes to discarding patterns of
Pacific ocean perch. No discarding was assumed in the At-sea hake and
the foreign fisheries.

The following distributions were assumed for data fitting. Survey
indices were lognormal, total discards were lognormal.

\subsubsection{Modeling Software}\label{modeling-software}

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.05 by Dr.~Richard
Methot at the NWFSC (Methot and Wetzel
\protect\hyperlink{ref-methot_stock_2013}{2013}). This most recent
version was used, since it included improvements and corrections to
older versions. The previous assessment of Pacific ocean perch also used
Stock Synthesis but a earlier version, 3.24, model bridging was
performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:bridge}.

\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}

A prior distribution was developed for natural mortality (\(M\)) from an
analysis based on an assumed maximum age of 100 years. The analysis was
performed by Owen Hamel (personal communications, NWFSC, NOAA) and used
data from Then et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-then_evaluating_2015}{2015}) to provide a
lognormal distribution for natural mortality. The median of the
lognormal prior is 0.054 and has a standard error of 0.438.

The prior for steepness (\(h\)) assumes a beta distribution with
parameters based on an update of the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior
(commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by
James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed
and endorsed by the Science and Statistical Committee in 2017. The prior
is a beta distribution with \(\mu\)=0.72 and \(\sigma\)=0.15. However,
fixing steepness within the model resulted in what was determined to be
unrealistic relative biomass levels (\(>\) 1), and it was decided to fix
steepness at 0.50. The previous assessment estimated and fixed steepness
equal to 0.40. The current data does not contain information regarding
steepness and 0.50 was selected as an intermediate value between the
prior and the previous assessment value. The steepness value of 0.50 was
contained within the estimated uncertainty envelope from the assessment
model when either the prior value of 0.72 or 0.40 values were assumed.

\subsubsection{Data Weighting}\label{data-weighting}

The base case was weighted such that the various data sources were
mostly consistent with each other in terms of the relationship between
input and effective sample sizes. Length and age-at-length compositions
from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey were fit along with length and
marginal age compositions from the fishery and other survey fleets.
Length data started with a sample size determined from the equation
listed in
\ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}
(survey data) and Section \ref{fishery-length-and-age-data} (fishery
data). Age-at-length data assumed that each age was a random sample
within the length bin and started with a sample size equal to the number
of fish in that length bin. However, the 2016 NWFSC shelf-slope
age-at-length data was variable compared to previous years for both
males and females relative to all other years with observed fish being
larger at age. Due to the increased variability within this data year,
the effective sample size for this year was reduced to 50\% of the
number of fish within each length-age bin.

One extra variability parameter was estimated and added to the input
variance for the Triennial and the NWFSC shelf-slope survey indices.
Estimating additional variance for the CPUE and other surveys were
explored and determined to not be required. Vessels present in the WCGOP
data were bootstrapped to provide uncertainty of the total discards
(Table \ref{tab:Discard}).

The base case assessment model was weighted using the ``Francis
method'', which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-francis_data_2011}{2011}). This formulation
looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to
determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If
the variability around the mean does not encompass the model
predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method
does account for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial
distribution) as opposed to the McAllister and Ianelli
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcallister_bayesian_1997}{1997}) method of
looking at the difference between individual observations and
predictions.

\subsubsection{Estimated And Fixed
Parameters}\label{estimated-and-fixed-parameters}

There were 164 estimated parameters in the base case model. These
included one parameter for \(R_0\), 8 parameters for growth, 2
parameters for extra variability on the Triennial and NWFSC shelf-slope
surveys indices, 24 parameters for selectivity, retention, and time
blocking of the fleets and the surveys, 117 recruitment deviations, and
12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:model_params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at
0.50. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were done for
steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.054 for females and males,
which is the median of the prior. The standard deviation of recruitment
deviates was fixed at 0.70. Maturity-at-length was fixed as described in
Section \ref{sex-ratio-maturation-and-fecundity}. Length-weight
parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight observations
(Figure \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model.
Older Pacific ocean perch are often found in deeper waters and may move
into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear, especially
trawl gear. Domed shape selectivity was determined to provide the best
fit to the data for the fishery fleet and the Triennial survey. The
final base model assumed asymptotic selectivity for the At-sea hake
fishery, and all other surveys.

\subsection{Model Selection and
Evaluation}\label{model-selection-and-evaluation}

The base case assessment model for Pacific ocean perch was developed to
balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a biomass
trajectory for the population of Pacific ocean perch on the west coast
of the US. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and
uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of
investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base case model.

\subsubsection{Key Assumptions and Structural
Choices}\label{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}

The key assumptions in the model were that the assessed population is a
single stock with biological parameters characterizing the entire coast,
maturity at age has remained constant over the period modeled,
weight-at-length has remained constant over the period modeled, the
standard deviation in recruitment deviation is 0.70, and steepness is
0.50. These are simplifying assumptions that unfortunately cannot be
verified or disproved. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for most of
these assumptions to determine their effect on the results.

Structurally, the model assumed that the catches from each fleet were
representative of the coastwide population, instead of specific areas,
and fishing mortality prior to 1918 was negligible. It also assumed that
discards were low prior to 1992 and after 2010.

\subsubsection{Alternate Models
Considered}\label{alternate-models-considered}

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2011 assessment to
Stock Synthesis version 3.30.03.05, which produced no discernible
difference. The updated catch series with discards added per the 2011
assessment produced insignificant differences in the relative scale of
the population although the updated historical removals resulted in an
increase in the estimate of unfished biomass. Updating the survey
indices produced small differences in the relative scale of the
population. Adding age and length data each resulted in less of a
population decline from the 1970s to pre-2000, resulting in an increase
in the estimated final stock status as of 2016. However, the addition of
new data resulted in an early pattern within recruitment, indicating
that the assumptions within the previous model may not represent the
best fit to the current data.

This assessment estimated discards in the model, so time was spent
investigating time blocks for changes in selectivity and retention to
match the limited discard data as best as possible. Using major changes
in management and observed changes in landings, a set of blocks for
retention was found for the bottom trawl fleets. In the spirit of
parsimony, we used as few blocks as possible, allowed blocks only for
time periods with data, and added new blocks when we felt they were
justified by changes in management and they improved the fit to the
data.

Natural mortality was also investigated and a new prior was developed
assuming a maximum age of 100 years for females and males. The previous
assessment estimated male natural mortality as an offset from female
natural mortality which was fixed at the median of the 2011 prior
(0.05). This assessment attempted to estimate natural mortality for both
sexes using the 2017 updated prior, but there was little to no
information on natural mortality within the data and hence opted to fix
the value for females. Upon additional exploration, the model estimated
very little difference in male natural mortality relative to females
(\textless{} 0.002) and in the interest of selecting the model that fit
the data with the fewest parameters required, males were fixed equal to
the female natural mortality.

Finally, multiple models were investigated where steepness was either
estimated, fixed at the prior, or at an alternate value. The assessment
in 2011 determined that there was sufficient information concerning
steepness where the parameter was estimated and then fixed at 0.40.
Based upon likelihood profiles performed on the current assessment,
there was no longer support for a steepness value of 0.40 and the
likelihood profile was flat across various levels of steepness with a
very small improvement in likelihood (\textless{}0.50 log likelihood
units) at the lowest steepness values. Estimating steepness starting at
the median of the ``type C'' prior, the meta-analysis prior evaluated
omitting information from Pacific ocean perch, of 0.76 resulted in very
little if any movement from the median value due to the flat likelihood
surface across values for this parameter with final relative stock
status for 2017 being estimated to \textgreater{} 100\% of unfished
biomass. Fixing steepness at the median of the prior of 0.72 resulted in
relative stock status estimates for 2017 at 98.6\% of unfished biomass.
It was determined that the resulting stock status estimates when
steepness was fixed at the meta-analysis prior were overly optimistic
and unrealistic given the biology and historical exploitation of Pacific
ocean perch.

\subsubsection{Convergence}\label{convergence}

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process
from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine
if the model found a better minimum. This was repeated 100 times and a
better minimum was not found (Table \ref{tab:jitter}). The model did not
experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values.
Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles,
we are confident that the base case as presented represents the best fit
to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in
inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much
of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate
a Hessian.

\subsection{Response To The Current STAR Panel
Requests}\label{response-to-the-current-star-panel-requests}

TBD after the STAR panel.

\subsection{Base Model Results}\label{base-model-results}

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic
standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the
likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:like}. Estimates of
derived reference points and approximate 95\% asymptotic confidence
intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts}. Time-series of estimated
stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimates}\label{parameter-estimates}

The estimates of maximum length and the von Bertanlaffy growth
coefficient, \(k\), were less than the the external estimates for males
and females (Figure \ref{fig:Len_Age}), but were well within the 95\%
confidence interval given the estimated uncertainty (Table
\ref{tab:model_params} and Figure \ref{fig:sizeatage}). Female and male
Pacific ocean perch grow quickly at younger ages, reaching near maximum
length by age 20, with female Pacific ocean perch reaching larger
maximum lengths.

Selectivity curves were estimated for commercial and survey fleets. The
estimated selectivity for all fleets within the model are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The fishery selectivity was estimated dome
shaped, reaching maximum selectivity for fish between 35 and 40 cm. The
At-sea hake fishery was estimated to have little selectivity for smaller
Pacific ocean perch and only reaching full selectivity at the largest
sizes. Survey selectivities, excluding the Triennial survey, were
estimated asymptotic during model explorations with the final
selectivity fixed asymptotic in the final base model. The Triennial
survey selectivity peaked at lengths between 25 and 30 cm and declined
before reaching a constant selectivity for larger Pacific ocean perch.
The foreign fleet for which only catch data are available was assumed to
be identical to the main fishery, although a sensitivity was performed
(not shown) that mirrored the foreign selectivity to that of the Pacific
ocean perch survey selectivity resulting in a negligible difference in
stock status.

Retention curves were estimated for the fishery fleet only and were
allowed to vary based upon discard data within the model over time
(Figure \ref{fig:retention}). Historical retention was estimated high
and declined over time due to management restriction on landings of
Pacific ocean perch with the lowest retention occurring in 2009 and 2010
prior to the implementation of ITQs. Post-2011 retention was estimated
to be nearly 100\% for the fishery fleet.

Additional survey variability (process error added directly to each
year's input variability) for the Triennial and the NWFSC shelf-slope
surveys were estimated within the model. The estimated added variance
for the Triennial survey was high at 0.39. The model estimated a small
added variance for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey of 0.03. Preliminary
models explored estimating added variance for each of the other indices,
but resulted in no added variance being estimated and hence were not
estimated in the base model.

Estimates of recruitment suggest that the Pacific ocean perch population
is characterized by variable recruitment with occasional strong
recruitments and periods of low recruitment (Figures \ref{fig:recruits}
and \ref{fig:recdevs}). There is little information regarding
recruitment prior to 1970 and the uncertainty in those estimates is
expressed in the model. The four lowest recruitments (in ascending
order) occurred in 2012, 2003, 1998, and 2005. There are very large, but
uncertain, estimates of recruitment in 2008, 2013, 2000, and 1999. The
2008 recruitment event is estimated to be larger by an order of
magnitude than any other recruitment estimated in the model. The
uncertainty interval in number of recruits is large based on the
uncertainty surrounding the spawning output in that year. However, the
log recruitment deviation estimated uncertainty is low.

\subsubsection{Fits to the Data}\label{fits-to-the-data}

There are numerous types of data for which the fits are discussed:
fishery CPUE index, survey abundance indices, discard data (biomass and
length compositions), length composition data for the fisheries and
surveys, marginal age compositions for the fisheries and surveys, and
conditional age-at-length observations for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey

The fits the fishery CPUE and five survey indices are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:index_fits}. Extra standard error was estimated for the
Triennial and NWFSC shelf-slope surveys. The fishery CPUE and Pacific
ocean perch survey index were fit well by the model. The first two years
of the Triennial survey index, 1980 and 1983, were much higher than the
later years and were poorly fit by the model. Both the AFSC and NWFSC
slope survey indices were generally flat and fit well by the model. The
recent NWFSC shelf-slope survey showed a variable trend over the time
period with the 2016 data point being the highest estimate of the series
and given the uncertainty around each data point the model fit the model
fit fell with the uncertainty interval for all years.

Fits to the total observed discard amounts required time blocks (Figure
\ref{fig:discard_fits}). Fits to the trawl discards from the Pikitch
data in 1985-1987 were quite good. Discard rate change modeled over the
1992 - 2001 was based on management restrictions which were assumed to
have increased discarding practices in the fishery fleet. The next
required time block was based on the WCGOP data from 2002-2007 and were
fit well by the model. Discarding increased prior to the implementation
to ITQs requiring blocks for 2008 and the 2009-2010 periods. The model
fit the very low post-ITQ discard rates based on the WCGOP data well.

Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of lengths
observed by year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets.
Detailed fits to the length data by year and fleet are provided in
Appendix \ref{appendix-a.-detailed-fit-to-length-composition-data}.
Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:length_agg}. There
are a few things that stand out when examining the aggregated length
composition data. First, the sexed discard lengths appear to be poorly
fit by the model but this is related to small sample sizes. The NWFS
slope survey lengths were under estimated by the model, but these data
are over only two years. Finally, both the Triennial and the NWFSC
shelf-slope surveys select both young and old fish in contrast to the
other data sources where typically only larger fish were observed.

Discard lengths from the Pikitch data (1986) and the WCGOP were fit well
by the model and show no obvious pattern in the residuals (Figure
\ref{fig:discard_len_pearson}). The residuals to the fishery lengths
clearly showed the growth differential between males and females where
the majority of residuals at larger sizes were from female fish (Figure
\ref{fig:fishery_len_pearson}). The fishery showed large positive
residuals for smaller fish for 2013-2016 which are attributed to the
strong 2008 year class moving through the fishery. The At-sea hake
fishery did not show an obvious pattern in residuals but clearly showed
the selectivity of the fishery for larger fish (Figure
\ref{fig:ashop_len_pearson}). The residuals for each of the surveys are
shown in Figures \ref{fig:pop_len_pearson}, \ref{fig:tri_len_pearson},
\ref{fig:afsc_len_pearson}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_len_pearson}, and
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_len_pearson}. The Pearson residuals from the NWFSC
shelf-slope survey clearly showed the strong year classes moving through
the population.

The model was weighted according to the Francis weights which adjust the
weight given to a data set based on the fit to the mean lengths by year.
The mean lengths and the estimated model fits are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:weighting_len_fishery}, \ref{fig:weighting_len_ashop},
\ref{fig:weighting_len_pop}, \ref{fig:weighting_len_triennial},
\ref{fig:weighting_len_afsc}, \ref{fig:weighting_len_nwfsc}, and
\ref{fig:weighting_len_nwfsccombo}. The mean lengths from the fishery
were consistent across the sampled period (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_fishery}), showing only a decline in the mean length
in 2013-2015 likely due to the large 2008 cohort. The At-sea hake
fishery showed and increase in the mean length of fish observed to 2009
and then fluctuated at larger mean lengths (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_ashop}). The Triennial survey had a decreasing and
then increasing trend in the mean lengths over the sample period (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_len_triennial}). The trend in the mean lengths
observed by the AFSC slope survey was generally flat excluding the
samples from 1997 which were smaller fish (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_len_afsc}). The NWFSC slope length data from 2001 and
2002 were highly variable with differing mean lengths between the years
which were not fit well by the model (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_len_nwfsc}). The mean length for the NWFSC
shelf-slope survey declined in 2012 and 2016 due to a large observation
of young small fish by the survey (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_len_nwfsccombo}).

Age data were fitted to as marginal age compositions for the main
fishery fleet, the At-sea hake fleet, the Pacific ocean perch survey,
the Triennial survey, and the NWFSC slope survey. The NWFSC shelf-slope
ages were treated as conditional age-at-length data in order to
facilitate the estimation of growth within the model. The aggregated
fits to the marginal age data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:age_agg}. The
aggregated age data was fit well for the fishery fleet which had the
largest sample of ages. The At-sea hake fleet and the surveys had
significantly lower sample sizes which resulted in spikey patterns in
the aggregated data. However, the model generally captured the trend of
the data. Detailed fits to the age data by year and fleet are provided
in Appendix \ref{appendix-b.-detailed-fit-to-age-composition-data}.

The Pearson residuals for the main fishery fleet are show in Figure
\ref{fig:fishery_age_pearson}. There are diagonal patterns in the
residuals across year which likely are cohorts moving through the
fishery. The At-sea hake fishery only had age data for four
non-consecutive years, combined with the tendency of this fleet to
select older fish, prevented general conclusions regarding fits to the
data over time and cohort strength over time (Figure
\ref{fig:ashop_age_pearson}). The Pacific ocean perch survey only had
one year of age data (the 1979 were all surface reads) but both sexes
had a larger observed number of older fish relative to the model
estimate (Figure \ref{fig:pop_age_pearson}). The Triennial age data
which ranged from 1989-2004 did not show a clear pattern in residuals
(Figure \ref{fig:tri_age_pearson}). However, the final year of the
survey, 2004, did have an increase in positive residuals for female fish
compared to earlier years. The Pearson residuals for the two years of
age data from NWFSC slope survey are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:nwfsc_age_pearson}. The residual pattern differs between the
years and by sex with positive residuals of male fish across ages in the
2001 data.

The observed and expected age-at-length are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_1}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_2},
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_3}, \ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_4}, and
\ref{fig:nwfsc_combo_andre_4} for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey
observations. The fits generally match the observations. Some outliers
are apparent with large residuals. The 2016 data varies from previous
years where larger fish across all ages have higher observations
compared to the model expectation.

The age data were also weighted according the Francis weighting which
adjust the weight given to a data set based on the fit to the mean
lengths by year. The mean age and the estimated model fits are shown in
Figures \ref{fig:weighting_fishery}, \ref{fig:weighting_ashop},
\ref{fig:weighting_triennial}, \ref{fig:weighting_nwfscslope}, and
\ref{fig:weighting_nwfsccombo}. The mean ages from the fishery appear to
have declined in recent years which could be due to incoming cohorts
(Figure \ref{fig:weighting_fishery}). The At-sea hake fishery mean age
are similar for 2006 and 2007 but both 2003 and 2014 have lower average
age in the samples (Figure \ref{fig:weighting_ashop}). The mean age for
the Triennial survey varied across the sampling period but the
distribution of sampled ages were highly variable across the years
(Figure \ref{fig:weighting_triennial}). The NWFSC slope had a decline in
the mean age between the two data years (Figure
\ref{fig:weighting_nwfscslope}). The mean age for the NWFSC shelf-slope
survey generally showed a declining trend over the time-series excluding
2012 and 2016 which sampled older fish relative to the surrounding years
(Figure \ref{fig:weighting_nwfsccombo}).

\subsubsection{Population trajectory}\label{population-trajectory}

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table
\ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The
predicted spawning output from the base model generally showed a slight
decline over the time-series until when the foreign fleet began. A
short, but sharp decline occurred during the period of the foreign
fishery in the late 1960s. The stock continued to decline minimally
until 2000 when a combination of strong recruitment and low catches
resulted in an increase at the end of the time-series. The recent
increase is even faster for total biomass (Figure \ref{fig:total_bio})
because not all fish from the 2008 recruitment are mature (Figure
\ref{fig:mat_compare}). The 2017 spawning biomass relative to unfished
equilibrium spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished
spawning biomass (76.1\%), with a low of 34.5\% in 1994 (Figure
\ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based on the
asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated
spawning biomass is high, especially in the early years. The standard
deviation of the log of the spawning biomass in 2017 is 0.28.

Recruitment deviations were estimated for the entire time series that
was modeled (Figure \ref{fig:recruits} and discussed in Section
\ref{parameter-estimates}) and provide a more realistic portrayal of
uncertainty. Recruitment predictions from the mid-1970s and early 1980s
were mostly below average, with the 1999, 2000, 2008, and 2013 cohorts
being the strongest over the modeled period. Many other stock
assessments of rockfish along the west coast of the US have estimated a
large recruitment event in 1999 (e.g., greenstriped rockfish (Hicks et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-hicks_status_2009}{2009}) chilipepper
rockfish (Field \protect\hyperlink{ref-field_status_2007}{2007}),
darkblotched rockfish (Gertseva et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gertseva_status_2015}{2015})). The 2008 year
classes was estimated as the strongest year class. This year has been
estimated to have very strong year classes for other West Coast stocks
(e.g darkblotched rockfish (Gertseva et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gertseva_status_2015}{2015}), widow rockfish
(Hicks and Wetzel \protect\hyperlink{ref-hicks_status_2015}{2015})). It
may be worthwhile to investigate the periods of strong and weak year
classes further to see if it is an artifact of the data, a consistent
autocorrelation, or a result of the environment.

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a fixed value of steepness is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:stock_recruit_curve} with estimated
recruitments also shown. The stock is predicted to have never fallen to
low enough levels that the steepness is obvious. However, the lowest
levels of predicted spawning biomass showed some of the smallest
recruitments and very few above average recruitments. Steepness was not
estimated in this model, but sensitivities to alternative values of
steepness are discussed below.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty and Sensitivity
Analyses}\label{uncertainty-and-sensitivity-analyses}

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Data weighting according to the harmonic mean.
  
  \item Fixed steepness at the prior value of 0.72.
  
  \item Estimate natural mortality for female and male Pacific ocean perch.
  
  \item Maturity relationship used in the previous assessment.
  
  \item Fecundity relationship used in the previous assessment.
  
  \item Split the Triennial survey into two time-series, early (1980-1992) and late (1995-2004).
  
  \item Remove the historical commercial CPUE index.
  
  \item Inclusion of available Canadian fishery and survey data (does not constitute all data used in Canadian assessments).
  
  \item Inclusion of historical Washington research lengths.
  
  \item Inclusion of Oregon special projects length and age data which are sampled at the dockside or processing facilities.
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity
are available in Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity1} and
\ref{tab:Sensitivity2}. Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning
output and relative biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens1_ssb},
\ref{fig:sens1_depl}, \ref{fig:sens2_ssb}, and \ref{fig:sens2_depl}.

The sensitivities which explored steepness or natural mortality had the
largest change in estimated stock status relative to the base model.
Fixing steepness at the prior value resulted in the stock being near
unfished spawning biomass output. When natural mortality was estimated
the estimated values were higher relative to the median of the prior
used in base model, resulting in the relative biomass to be
\textgreater{} 93\%.

Including additional data from either Canada, Washington research
lengths, and or Oregon special projects data resulted in estimated lower
stock status relative to the base model. However, the status was still
well above the management target.

Weighting the data according to the harmonic means resulted in the
largest decrease in the estimated stock status relative to the base
model with the stock being estimated at 68\% of unfished biomass.

The sensitivities that explored the removal of the CPUE index, the 2011
maturity, or fecundity relationship had little impact relative to the
base model results.

\subsubsection{Retrospective Analysis}\label{retrospective-analysis}

A 5-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using
data only through 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, progressively
(Figure \ref{fig:retro_sb} and \ref{fig:retro_recdev}). The initial
scale of the spawning population was basically unchanged for all of
these retrospectives. The estimation of the 2008 recruitment deviation
decreased as more data was removed. Overall, no alarming trends were
present in the retrospective analysis.

\subsubsection{Likelihood Profiles}\label{likelihood-profiles}

Likelihood profiles were conducted for \(R_0\), steepness, and over
natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were
conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the
remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood was essentially flat between
values of 0.30 - 0.80 (Figure \ref{fig:piner_h}). Likelihood components
by data source show that the fishery length and age data supports a low
steepness value, but the NWFSC shelf-slope age data supports a higher
value for steepness. The Triennial survey index indicates a low value of
steepness while the other surveys do not provide information concerning
steepness. The relative biomass for Pacific ocean perch has a wide range
across different assumed values of steepness (Figure
\ref{fig:h_trajectory}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a natural mortality value
of 0.06, but the 95\% confidence interval extends over the majority of
natural mortality values. The age and length data likelihood
contribution was minimized at natural morality values ranging from
0.055-0.06 (Figure \ref{fig:m_like}). The relative biomass for Pacific
ocean perch widely varied across alternative values of natural mortality
(Figure \ref{fig:m_trajectory}).

In regards to values of \(R_0\), the negative log-likelihood was
minimized at approximately log(\(R_0\)) of 9.30 (Figure
\ref{fig:piner_R0}). The fishery and survey composition data was in
opposition regarding values of \(R_0\) where the fishery length and age
data indicated lower values of \(R_0\) while the survey ages from the
Pacific ocean perch and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys indicated a higher
value.

\subsubsection{Reference Points}\label{reference-points-1}

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and
catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model
(2016). Sustainable total yields (landings plus discards) were 1764.8 mt
when using an \(SPR_{50\%}\) reference harvest rate and with a 95\%
confidence interval of 1264.8 - 2264.8 mt based on estimates of
uncertainty. The spawning output equivalent to 40\% of the unfished
spawning output (\(SB_{40\%}\)) was 2653.2 millions of eggs. The recent
catches (landings plus discards) have been below the point estimate of
potential long-term yields calculated using an \(SPR_{50\%}\) reference
point and the population has been increasing over the last decade.

The predicted spawning biomass from the base model generally showed a
sharp decline during the 1960s, steep increase above unfished
equilibrium levels, followed by less of a decline until 2001 (Figure
\ref{fig:ssb}). Since 2001, the spawning biomass has been increasing due
to small catches, and recently, above average recruitment. The 2017
spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is
above the target of 40\% of unfished spawning biomass (Figure
\ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, \((1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})\),
exceeded the current estimates of the harvest rate limit
(\(SPR_{50\%}\)) throughout the 1960s as seen in Figure \ref{fig:SPR}.
Recent exploitation rates on Pacific ocean perch were predicted to be
much less than target levels. In recent years, the stock has experienced
exploitation rates that have been below the target level while the
biomass level has remained above the target level.

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts} shows the full suite of estimated reference
points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the
equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.50.

\section{Harvest Projections and Decision
Tables}\label{harvest-projections-and-decision-tables}

A twelve year projection of the base model with catches equal to the
estimated ACL for years 2019-2028 and a catch allocation equal to the
percentages for each fleet over the period of 2014-2016 predicts an
increase in the spawning output due to large 2008 cohort, with a slight
downturn beginning in 2023 (Table \ref{tab:Forecast_mod1}).

\hl{Add additional projection post STAR based upon the decision table.}

Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1_back}

\section{Regional Management
Considerations}\label{regional-management-considerations}

The distribution of Pacific ocean perch occur primarily in the US west
coast waters of Washington, Oregon, and northern California and hes is
currently managed to a species level with harvest limits set for the
stock north of the \(40^\circ 10^\prime\) latitude. The population
within this area is treated as a single stock due to the lack of
biological and genetic data indicating the presence of multiple stocks.
Analysis conducted within this assessment did not find support for
regional management within the area that Pacific ocean perch occur.

\section{Research Needs}\label{research-needs}

There are many areas of research that could be improved to benefit the
understanding and assessment of Pacific ocean perch. Below, are issues
that are considered of the importance.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Natural mortality}: Uncertainty in natural mortality translates into uncertain estimates of status and sustainable fishing levels for Pacific ocean perch. The collection of additional age data, re-reading of older age samples, reading old age samples that are unread, and improved understanding of the life-history of Pacific ocean perch may reduce that uncertainty.

\item \textbf{Steepness}: The amount of stock resilience, steepness, dictates the rate at which a stock can rebuild from low stock sizes.  Improved understanting regarding the steepness of US west coast Pacific ocean perch will reduce our uncertainty regarding current stock status.

\item \textbf{Basin-wide understanding of stock structure, biology, connectivity, and distribution:} This is a stock assessment for Pacific ocean perch off of the west coast of the US and does not consider data from British Columbia or Alaska. Further investigating and comparing the data and predictions from British Columbia and Alaska to determine if there are similarities with the US west Ccast observations would help to define the connectivity between Pacific ocean perch north and south of the U.S.-Canada border.

\end{enumerate}

  1/1/1999 &  ALL  &  for the limited entry fishery  A new three phase cumulative limit period system is introduced for 1999.  Phase 1 is a single cumulative limit period that is 3 months long, from January 1 - March 31.  Phase 2 has 3 separate 2 month cumulative limit periods of April 1 -  May 31, June 1 -  July 31, and August 1 - September 30.  Phase 3 has 3 separate 1 month cumulative limit periods of October 1-31, November 1-30, and December 1-31.  For all species except Pacific ocean perch and Bocaccio, there will be no monthly limit within the cumulative landings limit periods.  An option to apply cumulative trip limits lagged by 2 weeks (from the 16th to the 15th) was made available to limited entry trawl vessels when their permits were renewed for 1999.
