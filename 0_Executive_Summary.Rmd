#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (\emph{`r spp.sci`}) speciess off rockfish
off the U.S. West Coast from Northern California to the Canadian Border using data 
through `r LastYR`.  `r spp` are most abundant in the Gulf of Alaska and have observed off of Japan, in the Bering Sea, and south to Baja California,
although they are sparse south of Oregon and rare in southern California. \hl{Composition data indicate that
good recruitment years coincide in Oregon and Washington.} To date, no significant genetic differences have
been found in the range covered by this assessment.


##Landings{-}
The first year that harvest of `r spp` exceeded 1 mt off the U.S. West Coast first occured in 1929.  Catches ramped up in the 1940s with large removals in Washington waters.  During the 1950s the removals primarly occured in Oregon waters with catches from Washington declining following the 1940s. The largest removals in 1966-1968 were largely a result of harvest by foreing vessels.  The fishery proceed with more moderate removals ranging between 1,200 to 2,600 metric  tons per year between 1969 to 1980. Removals generally decined from 1981 to 1994 to between 1,000 and 1,700 metric tons per year. `r spp` was declared overfished in 1999 resulting in large reduction in harvest in recent years since the declaration.

##Data and Assessment{-}
This a new full assessment for `r spp` which was last assessed in 2011.  In this assessment, all aspects of the model including catches, data, and modelling assumptions were re-evaluated as much as possible. The assessment was conducted using the length- and age-structured modeling software Stock Synthesis (version 3.30).  The coastwide population was modeled assuming separate growth and mortality parameters for each sex (a two-sex model) from `r Dat_start_mod1` to `r LastYR`, and forecasted beyond `r LastYR`.

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were.....




##Reference Points{-}
\hl{Include:} management targets and definition of overfishing, including the harvest 
rate that brings the stock to equilibrium at $B_{40\%}$ (the $B_{MSY}$ proxy) and 
the equilibrium stock size that results from fishing at the default harvest rate 
(the $F_{MSY}$ proxy). Include a summary table that compares estimated reference 
points for SSB, SPR, Exploitation Rate and Yield based on SSBproxy for MSY, 
SPRproxy for MSY, and estimated MSY values

\hl{Write intro paragraph}

This stock assessment estimates that `r spp` in the `r mod1_label` are 
`r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MT>0,"above","below")` the biomass 
target, but `r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MSST>0,"above","below")` 
the minimum stock size threshold.  \hl{Add sentence about spawning output trend.} 
The estimated relative depletion level for \hl{Model 1} in `r LastYR` is 
`r Depl_mod1` (~95% asymptotic interval: $\pm$ `r Depl_mod1_CI`, corresponding 
to an unfished spawning output of `r paste(Spawn_mod1, fecund_unit,sep=' ')` 
(~95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(Spawn_mod1_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).  Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r Ref_pts_mod1[2,2]` mt in the 
base case model. The target spawning output based on the biomass target 
($SB_{40\%}$) is `r paste(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, which gives 
a catch of `r Ref_pts_mod1[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt.

##Research And Data Needs{-}
\hl{Include: identify information gaps that seriously impede the stock assessment.}    

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:

\begin{enumerate}

\item List item No. 1 in the list

\item List item No. 2 in the list, etc.

\end{enumerate}

##Rebuilding Projections{-}
\hl{Include: reference to the principal results from rebuilding analysis if the 
stock is overfished. This section should be included in the Final/SAFE version 
assessment document but is not required for draft assessments undergoing review. 
See Rebuilding Analysis terms of reference for detailed information on 
rebuilding analysis requirements.}
