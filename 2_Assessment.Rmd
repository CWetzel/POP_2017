##Fishery-Independent Data:

###Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) shelf-slope survey

The NWFSC shelf-slope survey is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design uses four chartered industry vessels in most years, assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells. The survey, which has been conducted from late-May to early-October each year, is divided into two 2-vessel passes of the coast, which are executed from north to south. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (~700) of cells from a very large population of possible cells (greater than 11,000) distributed from the Mexican to the Canadian border. 

The data from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey was analyzed using a spatial delta-generalized linear mixed model (delta-GLMM) [@thorson_comparing_2017]. Predicted fish biomass density is derived as the product of a "delta" portion for the probability of a non-zero catch and a second portion for the magnitude of the non-zero catches.  Further, the geostatistical GLMM framework can accommodate spatial autocorrelation.  Additional information about the approach and the software package it is implemented in are available from www.fishstats.org. \hl{describe VAST}

The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.

###Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) slope survey  

The NWFSC slope survey covered waters throughout the summer from 183 m to 1280 m north of $34^\circ 30^\prime$ S, which is near Point Conception. The survey strata used to expand the biomass data for this assessment are shown in \hl{Table 5}. 

The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.


###Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) slope survey 

The AFSC slope survey operated during autumn (October-November) aboard the R/V Miller Freeman. Partial survey coverage of the U.S. west coast occurred during 1988-96 and complete coverage (north of $34^\circ 30^\prime$ S) during 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Only the four years of consistent and complete surveys plus 1996, which surveyed north of $43^\circ$ N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border, were used in this assessment. The number of tows with length data ranged from 19 in 2000 to 48 in 1996 \ref{tab:AFSC_Lengths}.  Because a large number of positive tows occurred in 1996, it was decided to include that year, which surveyed from $43^\circ$ N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border. Therefore, only tows from $43^\circ$ N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border were used.

The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.

###Triennial Bottom Trawl Survey

The triennial survey was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and spanned the time-frame from 1977-2004. The survey's design and sampling methods are most recently described in [@weinberg_estimation_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated \hl{(Figure 5)}. The survey design has changed slightly over the period of time \hl{(Table 4, Figure 3)}. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey spanned from mid-July through early October; the 1995 survey was conducted from early June to late August; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July \hl{(Figure 4)}.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the West Coast south to $36.8^\circ$ N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 meters. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to $34.5^\circ$ N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 meters and surveyed south to $34.5^\circ$ N. In the final year of the triennial series (2004), the NWFSC's Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very similar protocols as the AFSC.

Given the different depths surveyed during 1977, the data from that year were not included in this assessment. Water hauls [@zimmermann_influence_2003] and tows located in Canadian waters were also excluded from the analysis of this survey. The survey was analyzed as an early series (1980-1992) and a late series (1995-2004), as has been done in other West Coast rockfish assessments.

The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.

###Pacific ocean perch Survey

A survey targeted designed to sample `r spp` was conducted in 1979 and again in 1985.  The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.

##Fishery-dependent data

###Commercial Fishery Landings

**Washington**

Historical commercial fishery landigns of `r spp` from Washington for the years 1918-2016 were obtained from Theresa Tsou (WDFW) and Phillip Weyland (WDFW).  This assessment is the first `r spp` assessment to include a state provide historical catch reconstruction and hence, the historical catches for Washington vary markedly from those used in the 2011 assessment.  Due to Recent landings (1981-2016) were obtained directly from Washington state rather than from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) due to identified missing catches not available within PacFIN for `r spp`.

**Oregon**

Historical commercial fishery landings of `r spp` from Oregon for the years 1892-1986 were obtained from Alison Dauble (ODFW). A description of the methods can be found in Karnowski et al. [-@karnowski_historical_2014]. Recent landings (1987-2016) were obtained from PacFIN retrieval dated \hl{March 3, 2015}, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).  The catch data in from the POP and POP2 categories contained within PacFIN for `r spp` were used for this assessment.  Additional cathes from 1987-1999 for `r spp` under the UROCK category not yet available in PacFIN were received directly from the state and combined with the catch data available for that period within PacFIN.

**California**

Historical commercial fishery landings of `r spp` were obtained from the online database of the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, also known as CALCOM (128.114.3.187) for the years 1916-1980. A description of the methods can be found in [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Recent landings  (1981-2016) were obtained from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) retrieval dated \hl{March 3, 2015}, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).

**At-sea fishery**

Catches of `r spp` are monitored aboard the vessel by observers in the At-Sea hake Observer program (ASHOP) and were available for the years of 1975-2016. Observers use a spatial sample design, based on weight, to randomly choose a portion of the haul to sample for species composition. For the last decade, this is typically 30-50% of the total weight. The total weight of the sample is determined by all catch passing over a flow scale. All species other than hake are removed and weighed, by species, on a motion compensated flatbed scale. Observers record the weights of all non-hake species. Non-hake species total weights are expanded in the database by using the proportion of the haul sampled to the total weight of the haul. The catches of non-hake species in unsampled hauls is determined using bycatch rates determined from sampled hauls. Since 2001, more than 97% of the hauls have been observed and sampled.

**Foreign**

From the 1960s through the early 1970s, foreign trawling enterprises harvested considerable amounts of rockfish off Washington and Oregon, and along with the domestic trawling fleet, landed large quantities of `r spp`. Foreign catches of individual species were estimated by @rogers_species_2003 and attributed to INPFC areas for the years of 1966-1976 for `r spp`. The foreign catches were combined across areas for a coastwide removal total.

###Discards

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from two different data sources.  The earliest source is called the Pikitch data and comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl discards from 1985-1987 [@pikitch_evaluation_1988].  The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N latitude and $42^\circ 60^\prime$ N. latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area [@pikitch_evaluation_1988 ; @rogers_numerical_1992].  Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears.  Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample.  Results of the Pikitch data were obtained from John Wallace (NWFSC, personal communication) in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of `r spp` and sex-specific length frequencies.  Discard estimates are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}.   

The second source is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).  This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations since 2003. Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the discard ratios of `r spp` from the WCGOP.  Since 2011, when the trawl rationalization program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100% for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates.  Discard rates were obtained for both the catch-share and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`.  A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial landings by each sector.  Discard length composition for the trawl fleet varied by year, with larger fish being discarded prior to 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:WCGOP_discard}).
 

###Historical Commercial Catch-per-unit effort

Data on catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in mt/hr from the domestic fishery were combined for the INPFC Vancouver and Columbia areas (Table \ref{tab:CPUE_Summary} from Gunderson [-@gunderson_population_1977]).  Although these data reflect catch rates for the US fleet, the highest catch rates coincided with the beginning of removals by the foreign fleet.  This suggest that, barring unaccounted changes in fishing efficiency during this period, the level of abundance was high at that time.  A CV of 0.40 was used in this assessment to be consistent with the CV observed in the survey data.

###Fishery Length And Age Data




<!--************BIOLOGICAL DATA*********************************************-->
##Biological Data

###Natural mortality

Historic `r spp` ages determined using scales and surface reading methods of otoliths, resulted in estimates of natural mortality of between 0.10 and 0.20yr^-1^ with a longevity
less than 30 years[@gunderson_population_1977].  Based on break-and-burn method of age determination using otoliths, the maximum age of `r spp` was revised to be 90 years [@chilton_age_1982]. The updated understanding concerning `r spp` longevity reduced the estimate of natural mortality based on Hoenig's [-@hoenig_empirical_1983] relationship to 0.059yr^-1^. The previous assessment applied a prior distribution on natural mortality based upon multiple life history correlates (including Hoenig's method, Gunderson gonadosomatic index [-@gunderson_trade-off_1997], and McCoy and Gillooly's [-@mccoy_predicting_2008] theoretical relationship) developed separately for female and male `r spp`.  This assessment also applied a prior on natural mortality.  However, the prior and standard deviation were generated as a non-linear function of maximum age as developed by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] and modified by  Owen Hamel which greatly improved the fit to the underlying age data to create the 'Hamel-Then' prior.  A maximum age of 100 was used in the development of the prior where female natural memorability was set equal to `r mod1$MGparmAdj$NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1[1]` and male natural mortality estimated as an offset from females at `r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1[1] * exp(mod1$MGparmAdj$NatM_p_1_Mal_GP_1[1]),3)`.

###Sex ratio, maturation, and fecundity

Examining all biological data sources, the sex ratio of young fish are within 5% of 1:1 by either length or age (Figure \ref{fig:sexratio} and \ref{fig:sexratio_Age}), and hence this assessment the sex ratio at birth was assumed to be 1:1.  This assessment assumed a logistic maturity-at-length curve based on analysis of 537 fish maturity samples collected from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey.  This is revised from the previous assessment which assumed maturity-at-age based on the work of Hannah and Parker [@hannah_age-modulated_2007].  Additionally, the new maturity-at-length curve is based on the estimate of functional maturity an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the
measured frequency of atretic cells (M. Head, personal communication).  The 50% size-at-maturity was estimated at 32.1 cm with maturity asymptoting to one for larger fish.

The fecundity-at-age has also been updated from the previous assessment based on new research.  Dick [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] estimated new fecundity relationships for select West Coast stocks where fecundity for `r spp` was estimated equal to `r mod1$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1]`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs. Spawning output at length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.

\vspace{.5cm}

###Length-weight relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all biological data available from fishery and fishery-independent data sources where the female weight-at-length in grams was estimated at `r mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1]`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1]`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm.

###Growth (length-at-age)

\hl{Write if estimated or fixed in the final model}

<!-- \hl{Length-at-age was initially estimated external to the population dynamics models 
using the von Bertalanffy growth curve, $L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, 
where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in years, $k$ is rate of 
increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic length.  } -->

normal distribution logistically transformed into each parameter's range 
[@methot_stock_2013]. Table \ref{tab:jitter} shows the results of running 100 jitters 
for each pre-STAR base model....
