##Fishery-Independent Data:

###Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) shelf-slope survey

The NWFSC shelf-slope survey is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design uses four chartered industry vessels in most years, assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells. The survey, which has been conducted from late-May to early-October each year, is divided into two 2-vessel passes of the coast, which are executed from north to south. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of cells from a very large population of possible cells (greater than 11,000) distributed from the Mexican to the Canadian border. 

The data from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey was analyzed using a spatio-temporal delta-model [@thorson_geostatistical_2015], implemented as an R package VAST [@thorson_comparing_2017] and publicly available online (https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST).  Spatial and spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter probability and positive catch rates, a logit-link for encounter probability, and a log-link for positive catch rates.  Vessel-year effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in the database, to account for the random selection of commercial vessels used during sampling [@helser_generalized_2004, @thorson_accounting_2014].  Spatial variation was approximated using 1000 knots, and use the bias-correction algorithm [@thorson_implementing_2016] in Template Model Builder [@kristensen_tmb:_2016].  Further details regarding model structure are available in the user manual (https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/blob/master/examples/VAST_user_manual.pdf).  

The smallest `r spp` tend to occur in the shallower depths (< 200 m) with only larger individuals occurring at depths deeper than 300 m. Data collected by the NWFSC Shelf-Slope survey between depths of 55 - 549 m and north of $42^\circ$ and south of $49^\circ$ were stratified to generate an index of abundance from 2003-2016. The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.  The lognormal distribution with random strata-year and vessel effects had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model.  The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:nw_qq}).  The indices for the NWFSC shelf-slope survey show a tentative decline in the population between 2003 and 2009, with an increasing trend in biomass between the 2009 and 2016 median point estimates.

Length, age, and conditional age-at-length compositions were expanded based upon the stratification.  The number of tows with length data ranged from 33 in 2006 to 69 in 2015 (Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Lengths}) where ages were collected for `r spp` in nearly every tow (Table \ref{tab:NWcombo_Ages}).  The expanded length frequencies from this survey show an increase in small fish starting in 2010 (Figure \ref{fig:nw_Length}).  The age frequencies provide clear evidence of large year-classes moving through the population from the 1999, 2000, and 2008 recruitment; with early indications of a large 2013 recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:nw_Age}).

The effective sample sizes for length and marginal age composition data for all fishery-independet surveys were calculated according to Stewart & Hamel [-@stewart_bootstrapping_2014] which determined that the approximate realized sample size for shelf/slope rockfish species was 2.43*$N_{\text{tow}}$.  The effective sample size of conditional-age-at-length data was set at the number of fish at each length by year.

###Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) slope survey  

The NWFSC slope survey covered waters throughout the summer from 183 m to 1280 m north of $34^\circ 30^\prime$ S, which is near Point Conception between 1999 and 2002.  Tows conducted between the depths of 183 and 549 m were used to create an index of abundance using the VAST delta-GLMM model.  The estimated index of abundance is show in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.  The lognormal distribution with random strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model.  \hl{The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figure XXXX}). } The trend of abundance across the four surveys years was generally flat with high estimated annual variance.

Length and age compositions were available for 2001 and 2002 and were expanded based upon the survey stratification (Tables \ref{tab:NWslope_Lengths} and \ref{tab:NWslope_Ages}.  The expanded length frequencies from this survey shows that primarily only large fish were captured both years (Figure \ref{fig:nw_slope_Length}).  The majority of fish observed by this survey were aged at greater than 10 years (Figure \ref{fig:nw_slope_Age}).


###Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) slope survey 

The AFSC slope survey operated during autumn (October-November) aboard the R/V Miller Freeman. Partial survey coverage of the U.S. west coast occurred during 1988-96 and complete coverage (north of $34^\circ 30^\prime$ S) during 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Only the four years of consistent and complete surveys plus 1996, which surveyed north of $43^\circ$ N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border, were used in this assessment. The number of tows with length data ranged from 19 in 2000 to 48 in 1996 (Table \ref{tab:AFSC_Lengths}).  Because a large number of positive tows occurred in 1996, it was decided to include that year, which surveyed from $43^\circ$ N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border. Therefore, only tows from $43^\circ$ N latitude to the U.S.-Canada border were used.

An index of abundance was estimated based on the data using the VAST delta-GLMM model.  The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.  The lognormal distribution with random strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model.  The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:afsc_qq}).  The trend in the indices was generally flat over time.

Length compositions were available for each year the survey was conducted.  No age data were available from this survey.  The expanded length frequencies from this survey were generally of larger fish ( > 30 cm), expect for 1997 where the highest frequency of fish were between 20 and 30 cm for both females and males (Figure \ref{fig:afsc_Length}). 

###Triennial Bottom Trawl Survey

The triennial survey was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and spanned the time-frame from 1977-2004. The survey's design and sampling methods are most recently described in [@weinberg_estimation_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design has changed slightly over the period of time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey spanned from mid-July through early October; the 1995 survey was conducted from early June to late August; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early August; and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the West Coast south to $36.8^\circ$ N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 meters. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to $34.5^\circ$ N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 meters and surveyed south to $34.5^\circ$ N. In the final year of the triennial series (2004), the NWFSC's Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very similar protocols as the AFSC.

Given the different depths surveyed during 1977, the data from that year were not included in this assessment. Water hauls [@zimmermann_influence_2003] and tows located in Canadian waters were also excluded from the analysis of this survey. The data was examined for varying distribution of length and/or ages of fish based upon the shift in survey timing and little evidence was found of ontogenetic shifts in `r spp` during the summer months.`r spp` are rarely encountered south of $40^circ$ where the change in southern range of the survey would have no impact on data collected regarding `r spp`. Given these factors the Triennial survey was analyzed as a single time-series a departure from how the previous assessment which split the time-series into and an  early (1980-1992) and a late period (1995-2004).  

An index of abundance was estimated based on the data using the VAST delta-GLMM model.  The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.  The lognormal distribution with random strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model.  The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:tri_qq}).  The index shows a decline in abundance in the early years of the time-series and abundance remaining flat for the latter years.  

Length and age compositions were expanded based upon the stratification.  The number of tows with length data ranged from 17 in 1986 to 81 in 1998 \ref{tab:TriennialLengths}.  Ages were read using surface reading methods until 1989 when the break-and-burn method replaced surface reads as the best method to age `r spp`.  Unfortunately, surface reading of `r spp` otoliths results in significant underestimates of age.  Due to this, these otolith were excluded from analysis.  The available ages from the Triennial survey and the number of tows where otoliths were collected are shown in Table \ref{tab:Triennial_Ages}.  The expanded length frequencies from this survey show an increase in small fish starting in 1995 (Figure \ref{fig:Tri_Length}).  The age frequencies provide clear evidence of large year-classes moving through the population from the 1999 and 2000 recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:Tri_Age}).

###Pacific ocean perch Survey

A survey targeted designed to sample `r spp` was conducted in 1979 and again in 1985 (for a detailed description see [@ianelli_status_1992].  An index of abundance was estimated based on the data using the VAST delta-GLMM model.  The estimated index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:Index_Summary}.  The lognormal distribution with random strata-year had the lowest AIC and was chosen as the final model.  The Q-Q plot does not show any departures from the assumed distribution (Figure \ref{fig:pop_qq}).  The index shows a clear decline in abundance between the two survey years. 

Length and age compositions were expanded based on the stratification. The survey had 125 and 126 `r spp` tows (Table \ref{tab:POP_Lengths}) and ages were only available in 1985 due to surface reads for the 1979 data (Table \ref{tab:POP_Ages}). The length frequencies for both years are highest between the 30-45 cm range (Figure \ref{fig:POP_Length}) with ages in 1985 having a large number of fish age 40 and greater (Figure \ref{fig:POP_Age}).

##Fishery-Dependent Data

###Commercial Fishery Landings

**Washington**

Historical commercial fishery landings of `r spp` from Washington for the years 1918-2016 were obtained from Theresa Tsou (WDFW) and Phillip Weyland (WDFW).  This assessment is the first `r spp` assessment to include a state provide historical catch reconstruction and hence, the historical catches for Washington vary markedly from those used in the 2011 assessment.  Due to Recent landings (1981-2016) were obtained directly from Washington state rather than from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) due to identified missing catches not available within PacFIN for `r spp`.

**Oregon**

Historical commercial fishery landings of `r spp` from Oregon for the years 1892-1986 were obtained from Alison Dauble (ODFW). A description of the methods can be found in Karnowski et al. [-@karnowski_historical_2014]. Recent landings (1987-2016) were obtained from PacFIN retrieval dated May 2, 2017}, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).  The catch data in from the POP and POP2 categories contained within PacFIN for `r spp` were used for this assessment.  Additional catches from 1987-1999 for `r spp` under the UROCK category not yet available in PacFIN were received directly from the state and combined with the catch data available for that period within PacFIN.

**California**

Historical commercial fishery landings of `r spp` were obtained directly from John Field at the SWFSC due to database issues for the historical period for the  California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, also known as CALCOM (128.114.3.187) for the years 1916-1980. A description of the methods can be found in [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Recent landings  (1981-2016) were obtained from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) retrieval dated May 2, 2017, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon; www.psmfc.org).

**At-Sea Hake Fishery**

Catches of `r spp` are monitored aboard the vessel by observers in the At-Sea hake Observer program (ASHOP) and were available for the years of 1975-2016. Observers use a spatial sample design, based on weight, to randomly choose a portion of the haul to sample for species composition. For the last decade, this is typically 30-50% of the total weight. The total weight of the sample is determined by all catch passing over a flow scale. All species other than hake are removed and weighed, by species, on a motion compensated flatbed scale. Observers record the weights of all non-hake species. Non-hake species total weights are expanded in the database by using the proportion of the haul sampled to the total weight of the haul. The catches of non-hake species in unsampled hauls is determined using bycatch rates determined from sampled hauls. Since 2001, more than 97% of the hauls have been observed and sampled.

**Foreign Catches**

From the 1960s through the early 1970s, foreign trawling enterprises harvested considerable amounts of rockfish off Washington and Oregon, and along with the domestic trawling fleet, landed large quantities of `r spp`. Foreign catches of individual species were estimated by @rogers_species_2003 and attributed to INPFC areas for the years of 1966-1976 for `r spp`. The foreign catches were combined across areas for a coastwide removal total.

###Discards

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from two different data sources.  The earliest source is called the Pikitch data and comes from a study organized by Ellen Pikitch that collected trawl discards from 1985-1987 [@pikitch_evaluation_1988].  The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N latitude and $42^\circ 60^\prime$ N. latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area [@pikitch_evaluation_1988 ; @rogers_numerical_1992].  Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears.  Observers of normal fishing operations on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample.  Results of the Pikitch data were obtained from John Wallace (NWFSC, personal communication) in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of `r spp` and sex-specific length frequencies.  Discard estimates are shown in Table \ref{tab:Discard}.   

The second source is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).  This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations since 2003. Table \ref{tab:Discard} shows the discard ratios (discarded/(discarded + retained)) of `r spp` from the WCGOP.  Since 2011, when the trawl rationalization program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100% for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates.  Discard rates were obtained for both the catch-share and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`.  A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial landings by each sector.  Coeffienct of variations were calculated by bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses vessels within porats to be observed in the non-catch shares sectors.  Discard length composition for the trawl fleet varied by year, with larger fish being discarded prior to 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:WCGOP_discard}).
 

###Historical Commercial Catch-per-unit effort

Data on catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in mt/hr from the domestic fishery were combined for the INPFC Vancouver and Columbia areas (Table \ref{tab:CPUE_Summary}, from Gunderson [-@gunderson_population_1977]).  Although these data reflect catch rates for the US fleet, the highest catch rates coincided with the beginning of removals by the foreign fleet.  This suggest that, barring unaccounted changes in fishing efficiency during this period, the level of abundance was high at that time.  A CV of 0.40 was used in this assessment to be consistent with the CV observed in the survey data.

###Fishery Length And Age Data
Biological data from commercial fisheries that caught `r spp` were extracted from PacFIN (PFSMFC) on \hl{XXXX}.  Lengths taken during port sampling in Oregon and Washington were used to calculate length and age compositions.  There were no biological data for `r spp` available within PacFIN.  The overwhelming majority of these data were collected from the mid-water and bottom trawl gear, but additional biological data were collected from non-trawl gear which was grouped together with trawl gear data. Tables \ref{tab:Comm_Lengths} and \ref{tab:Comm_Ages} show the number of trips and fish sampled, along with the calculated sample sizes.  Length and age data were acquired at the trip level, and then aggregated to the state level.  The sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart Method (Ian Stewart, pers. Comm.) which for commercial fishery data is:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}



<!--************BIOLOGICAL DATA*********************************************-->
##Biological Data

###Natural mortality

Historic `r spp` ages determined using scales and surface reading methods of otoliths, resulted in estimates of natural mortality ($M$) of between 0.10 and 0.20yr^-1^ with a longevity
less than 30 years[@gunderson_population_1977].  Based on break-and-burn method of age determination using otoliths, the maximum age of `r spp` was revised to be 90 years [@chilton_age_1982]. The updated understanding concerning `r spp` longevity reduced the estimate of natural mortality based on Hoenig's [-@hoenig_empirical_1983] relationship to 0.059yr^-1^. The previous assessment applied a prior distribution on natural mortality based upon multiple life history correlates (including Hoenig's method, Gunderson gonadosomatic index [-@gunderson_trade-off_1997], and McCoy and Gillooly's [-@mccoy_predicting_2008] theoretical relationship) developed separately for female and male `r spp`.  

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches to relating the natural mortality rate M to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate and reproductive effort, to provide a prior on $M$. In that same issue of ICESJMS, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015], provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species, from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares (nls) estimator M=4.899A_max^(-.916). The approach of basing M priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of M to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Revaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal with mean $ln(\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}})$ and SE = 0.4384343. Using a maximum age of 100 the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.054.



###Sex ratio, maturation, and fecundity

Examining all biological data sources, the sex ratio of young fish are within 5% of 1:1 by either length or age (Figures \ref{fig:sexratio} and \ref{fig:sexratio_Age}), and hence this assessment the sex ratio at birth was assumed to be 1:1.  This assessment assumed a logistic maturity-at-length curve based on analysis of 537 fish maturity samples collected from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey.  This is revised from the previous assessment which assumed maturity-at-age based on the work of Hannah and Parker [@hannah_age-modulated_2007].  Additionally, the new maturity-at-length curve is based on the estimate of functional maturity an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (M. Head, personal communication).  The 50% size-at-maturity was estimated at 32.1 cm with maturity asymptoting to one for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:mat}).  Comparison between the maturity-at-age used in the previous assessment and the updated functional maturity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mat_compare}.

The fecundity-at-age has also been updated from the previous assessment based on new research.  Dick [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] estimated new fecundity relationships for select West Coast stocks where fecundity for `r spp` was estimated equal to `r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1],12)`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs. Spawning output at length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.


###Length-weight relationship

The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all biological data available from fishery and fishery-independent data sources where the female weight-at-length in grams was estimated at `r mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1]`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males at `r mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1]`$L$^`r round(mod1$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:Wt_len} and \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).


###Growth (length-at-age)

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` using data collected from both fishery-dependent and -independent data sources that were collected from 1981-2016. Figure \ref{fig:Len_Age} shows the lengths and ages for all years and all data as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 42.32; $k$ = 0.169; $t_0$ = -1.466

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 39.03; $k$ = 0.212; $t_0$ = -1.02

\end{centering}


###Ageing Precision And Bias

Uncertainty surrounding the ageing-error process for `r spp` was incorporated by estimating ageing error by age. Age-composition data used in the model were from break-and-burn otolith reads aged by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon. Break-and-burn double reads of more than 1500 otoliths were provided by the CAP lab.  An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error [@punt_quantifying_2008], and using release 1.0.0 of the R package nwfscAgeingError [@thorson_nwfscageingerror:_2012] for input and output diagnostics, publicly available at: https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError. A non-linear standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in the estimated age of older fish was estimated (Table \ref{tab:Age_Error}, Figure \ref{fig:Age_Error}).

<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
##History Of Modeling Approaches Used For This Stock

###Previous Assessments
The status of `r spp` off British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon have been periodically assessed since the intensive exploitation that occured in the 1960s.  Concerns regarding `r spp` status off the coast the US west coast were raised in the late 1970s [@gunderson_results_1978, @gunderson_updated_1981] and in 1981 the PFMC adopted a 20-year plan to rebuild the stock. 

The 1992 assessment determined that `r spp` remained at low levels relative to the population size in 1960 [@ianelli_status_1992] and recommended additional harvest restrictions to allow for stock rebuilding.  The 1998 assessment [@ianelli_status_1998] estimated that the stock was 13% of the unfished level, leading the National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS) to declare the stock overfished in 1999.  The formal rebuilding plan was implemented in 2001.  The rebuilding plan reduced the SPR harvest rate used to determine catches to 0.864, relative to the PFMC rockfish default harvest (SPR = 0.50).  The last full assessment of `r spp` was conducted in 2011 [@hamel_stock_2011] which concluded that the stock was still well below the target biomass of $0.40SB_{0}$ estimating the relative stock status at 19.1%. 

###Previous Assessment Recommendations
Recommendation: Considering trans-boundary stock effects should be pursued. In particular the consequences of having spawning contributions from external stock components should be evaluated relative to the steepness estimates obtained in the present assessment (see more complete discussion of this recommendation under the Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties section, above).

*STAT response: The STAT team agrees that this should be an ongoing area of research and collaboration between the US and Canada.  This assessment presents a sensitivity where the inclusion of Canadian data are included within the model.*

Recommendation:The benefits of adopting the complex model used this year should be evaluated relative to simpler assumptions and models. While the transition from the simpler old model to
Stock Synthesis was shown to be similar for the historical period, the depletion estimates in the most recent years were different enough to warrant further investigation.

*STAT response: This assessment was performed in Stock Synthesis, an integrated model, which can be modified to either simple or complex structural forms based upon the available data and the processes being modeled.  There were not addtional explorations of alternative modeling platforms.*

Recommendation:Discard estimates from observer programs should be presented, reviewed (similar to the catch reconstructions), and be made available to the assessment process.

*STAT response: This assessment uses discard rates and discard lengths collected by the WCGOP from 2003-2015.*
  
Recommendation:The ability to allow different "plus groups" for specific data types should be evaluated (and implemented in Stock Synthesis).  For example, this would provide the ability to use the biased surface-aged data in an appropriate way.

*STAT response: Additional research needs to completed which evaluates the amount of bias and imprecision in surface-read ages.  Evaluating avaiable surface-read ages within the PacFIN database fish of lengths between 23-44 cm can be aged at 10 years old.  This large range of lengths at the same age indicates considerable bias in ages for fish surface-read younger aged fish.*

Recommendation:Historical catch reconstruction estimates should be formally reviewed prior to being used in assessments and should be coordinated so that interactions between stocks are appropriately treated. The relative reliability of the catch estimates over time could provide an axis of uncertainty in future assessments.

*STAT response: California and Oregon have ungone extensive work to create historical catch reconstructions.  This is the first assessment for `r spp` which includes a Washington historical catch reconstruction.  The data used in this assessment represent Washington state's current best estimate for historical catches.  Both California and Washington are conducting research to estimate uncertainty surround historical catches which could be used to propegate uncertainty within the assessment.*

#Assessment

##General Model Specifications and Assumptions
Stock Synthesis \hl{v3.30.03.03} was used to estimate the parameters in the model. R4SS, revision 1.26.0, along with R version 3.3.2 were used to investigate and plot model fits. A summary of the data sources used in the model (details discussed above) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:data_plot}.

Stock Synthesis has many options when setting up a model and the assessment model for `r spp` was set up in the following manner.

###Changes between the 2011 assessment model and current model
The current model for `r spp` has many made many similar assumptions to the 2011 assessment but differs in some key ways.  This assessment disaggrated the fleets into a trawl/other gear, at-sea hake, historical foreign fleet, and research fleets.  The previous assessment implemented a single fleet where removal from all sources were aggregated together.  The seperating of fleets applied in this assessment allowed for differing assumptions regarding current and historical discarding practices.  Although there are no compositional data available from the foreign fleet, it is assumed that very little discarding to no discarding of fish occured.  Additionally, the at-sea hake fishery removals are represent both discarded and retained fish and hence an additional discard rate would not be appropriate.  Similar logic was applied in regard to survey and research removals.  

The historical landing used in the model differs from those used in 2011.  The assessment includes the first state provided historical reconstruction landings for Washington state.  The historical reconstruction provided `r spp` landing within Washington state starting in 1916 and have significantly larger removals in the 1940s relative to those used in 2011.  Given the increase in historical removals prior to 1940, the 2011 model starting year, the starting year for modeling the stock was revised to 1918, the first year `r spp` landings exceeded 1 mt, for this assessment.  Explorations were conducted relative to the model starting year and no differences were found between the 1918 start year compared to starting the model in 1892, the first record of `r spp` landings between California, Oregon, and Washington catch data.

Selectivity in this model is assumed to be length-based and is modeled using double-normal for all fleets, expect the `r spp` survey which retained the previous assessment assumption of logistic selectivity. The previous assessment mirrored selectivity amont the `r spp` and both slope surveys (AFSC and NWFSC).  This assessment allow for survey specific estimated double-normal selectivity.

All fishery-independent indices have been reevaluated for this assessment using a spatial-temporal delta generalized linear mixed model (VAST delta-GLMM) which is updated from 2011 which used a bayesian delta-GLMM which did not incorporate spatial effects.  An additional update to the treatment of survey data was the decision to use the Triennial survey as a single time series ranging from 1980-2004.  The previous assessment opted to split this survey into early and a late index of abundance based upon the change in southern sampling and a shift in survey timing.  Northern California is considered to be the southern end of `r spp` West Coast distribution with rare encounters in central or southern California waters.  The biological data from the Triennial survey showed no discernable ontogenetic shifts in `r spp` during the early or late period of summer samples.  Based upon these investigations, the Triennial survey was retained as a single index of abundance.

Maturity and fecundity were updated for this assessment based upon new research. Fecundity for `r spp` used in this assessment was base on reevaluation of the fecundity of West Coast rockfish by Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] updating the previous fecundity estimates used in the 2011 assessment [@dick_modeling_2009].  Maturity in this assessment was based on examination of 537 fish samples which were used to estimate functional maturity, an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (M. Head, personal communication).  The updated maturity curve was based on maturity-at-length where the previous estimates used in 2011 were based on maturity-at-age. 

In this assessment, the beta prior developed from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish was updated to the 2017 value (J. Thorson personal communication) in preliminary models, with steepness fixed in the final base model.  Additionally, the prior for natural mortality was updated base on analysis conducted by Owen Hamel (personal communication), where female natural mortality was fixed at the prior median with males estimated as an offset from the female value.


###Summary of Fleets and Areas

`r spp` are most frequently observed in Oregon and Washington waters, however, they are observed along the entire US West Coast in survey and fishery observations. Multiple fisheries encounter `r spp`. Trawl, fixed gear, and the at-sea (mid-water) hake fisheries account for the majority of the `r spp` landings both historically and currently.

The majoirty of removals of `r spp` were observed by eht bottom trawl fishery with fixed gear accounting for a small fraction of the catches avaiable within PacFIN. Trawl and fixed gears were combined into a coast-wide fleet. For the period from 1918 to the early 1990s, prior to the introduction of trip limits for rockfish, limited discarding of `r spp` was assumed. Observations of `r spp` in the Pikitch et al. (1988) data (1986-1987) allowed for a formal analysis of discard rates which were applied to the historical period of the fishery. Foreign trawl catches (1966-1976) was modeled as a single fleet.  The at-sea fishery operates as a mid-water fishery targeting Pacific whiting but encounters `r spp` as a bycatch species. This fleet was also modeled as a single fleet.


###Other Specifications

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model starting in 1918 with an accumulated age group at 60 years. Growth was estimated and natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior. The lengths in the population were tracked by 1 cm intervals and the length data were binned into 1 cm intervals. A curvilinear ageing imprecision relationship was estimated and used to model ageing error. Fecundity-at-length was defined fixed at the values from Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017] for `r spp` and spawning output was defined in millions of eggs.

The Triennial survey was kept as a single series. Assessment of other groundfish have split this survey into an early and a late series, based mostly on the shift to deeper depths and the timing of the survey, by estimating different catchability parameters and selectivity parameters for each period. Age data were available for the commercial and at-sea hake fishery, as well as the Triennial, the `r spp`, the NWFSC slope, and the NWFSC shelf-slope survies.  The ages from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey and were entered into the model as conditional age-at-length. Length-frequencies were calculated for the Triennial, `r spp`, AFSC slope, NWFSC slope,  and the NWFSC shelf-slope surveys within each stratum, and then combined across strata using the biomass in each stratum as the weighting factor. This reduced the influence of a few fish observed in a large area.

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that likely affects model uncertainty. It was decided to estimate recruitment deviations from 1900-2014 to appropriately quantify uncertainty. The earliest length-composition data occur in 1966 and the earliest age data were in 1981. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations were from about the mid-1970s to about 2011. The period from 1900-1974 was fit using an early series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from 1975-2014 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment, and 2015 onward was fit using forecast recruitment deviates with little bias adjustment. Methot and Taylor [-@methot_adjusting_2011] summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. Recruitment deviation was assumed to be `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`.

The recommended selectivity type in Stock Synthesis is the double normal and was used in this assessment for the all fleets, except the `r spp` survey which was assumed logistic based on the length composition data. Changes in retention curves were estimated for the commercial fishery.

Time blocks for the bottom trawl, midwater trawl, and hook-and-line fishery are provided in Table \ref{tab:Model_setup}. Fishery selectivity retention has changed over the modeled period due to management changes. The time block on the retention curves for the trawl fishery were set from 1918-1991, 1992-2001, 2002-2007, 2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2016  based on available discarding data and changes in trip limits that likely resulted in changes to discarding patterns of `r spp`. No discarding was assumed in the at-sea hake and the foreign fisheries.

The following distributions were assumed for data fitting. Survey indices were lognormal, total discards were lognormal.


###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version \hl{3.30.03.03} by Dr. Richard Methot at the NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used, since it included improvements and corrections to older versions.


###Priors
A prior distribution was developed for the natural mortality parameter from an analysis of a maximum age of 100 years. The analysis was performed by Owen Hamel (pers comm, NWFSC, NOAA) and used data from Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] to provide a lognormal distribution for natural mortality. The median of the lognormal prior is 0.054 and has a standard error of 0.4384343. 

The prior for steepness ($h$) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update of the Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by J. Thorson (pers. comm, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the SSC in 2017. The prior is a beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.15. However, fixing steepness within the model resulted in unrealistic relative biomass levels ($>$ 1), it was also decided to fix steepness at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`.  The previous assessment estimated and fixed steepness equal to 0.40.  The current data does not contain information regarding steepness and `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` was selected as an intermediate value between the prior and the previous assessment value.  The steepness value of `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` was contained within the estimated uncertainty envelope from the assessment model when either the prior value of 0.72 or 0.40 values were assumed.

###Data Weighting

The base case was weighted such that the various data sources were mostly consistent with each other in terms of the relationship between input and effective sample sizes. Length and age-at-length compositions from the NWFSC shelf-slope survey were fit along with length and marginal age compositions from the fishery fleets. Length data started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Section \ref{fishery-length-and-age-data} and \ref{northwest-fisheries-science-center-nwfsc-shelf-slope-survey}. Age-at-length data assumed that each age was a random sample within the length bin and started with a sample size equal to the number of fish in that length bin . One extra variability parameter that was added to the input variance was estimated for the Triennial and the NWFSC shelf-slope survey indices. Vessels present in the WCGOP data were bootstrapped to provide uncertainty of the total discards (Table \ref{tab:Discard}).

The base case assessment model was weighted based on the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method does account for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution) as opposed to the McAllister and Ianelli [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method of looking at the difference between individual observations and predictions.


###Estimated And Fixed Parameters

There were 164 estimated parameters in the base case model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 8 parameters for growth, 2 parameters for extra variability on the Triennial and NWFSC shelf-slope surveys indices, 24 parameters for selectivity, retention, and time blocking of the fleets and the surveys, 117 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:model_params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were done for steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at `r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"],3)` for females and males, which is the median of the prior.  The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`. Maturity at age was fixed as described in Section \ref{sex-ratio-maturation-and-fecundity}. Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:Wt_len_pred}).

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for both the fishery and the surveys. Older `r spp` are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear, especially trawl gear. Domed shape selectivity was assumed for the fishery fleet and the Triennial survey. The final base model assumed asymptotic selectivity for the at-sea hake fishery, and all other surveys.

##Model Selection and Evaluation

The base case assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a biomass trajectory for the population of `r spp` on the west coast of the United States. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base case model.

###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

The key assumptions in the model were that the assessed population is a single stock with biological parameters characterizing the entire coast, maturity at age has remained constant over the period modeled, weight-at-length has remained constant over the period modeled, the standard deviation in recruitment deviation is `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`,  and steepness is `r print(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. These are simplifying assumptions that unfortunately cannot be verified or disproven. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for most of these assumptions to determine their effect on the results.

Structurally, the model assumed that the catches from each fleet were representative of the coastwide population, instead of specific areas, and fishing mortality prior to 1918 was negligible. It also assumed that discards were low prior to 1992 and after 2010.


###Alternate Models Considered
The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2011 assessment to SS version 3.24U, which produced no discernable difference. The updated catch series with discards added per the 2011 assessment produced insignificant differences in the relative scale of the population although the updated historical removals resulted in an increase in the estimate of unfishe biomass (Figure \ref{fig:XX}).   Updating the survey indices produced small differences in the relative scale of the population. Adding age and length data each resulted in an less of a population decline from the 1970s to pre-2000, resulting in an increase in the estimated final stock status as of 2017.  However, the addition of new data resulted in an early pattern within recruitment, indicating that the assumptions within the previous model may not represent the best fit to the current data.

This assessment estimated discards in the model, so time was spent investigating time blocks for changes in selectivity and retention to match the limited discard data as best as possible. Using major changes in management and observed changes in landings, a set of blocks for retention was found for the bottom trawl fleets. In the spirit of parsimony, we used as few blocks as possible, allowed blocks only for time periods with data, and added new blocks when we felt they were justified by changes in management and they improved the fit to the data.

Natural mortality was also investigated and a new prior was developed assuming a maximum age of 100 years for females and males. The previous assessment estimated male natural mortality as an offset from female natural mortality which was fixed at the median of the 2011 prior.  This assessment attempted to estimate natural mortality for both sexes using the 2017 updated prior, but there was little to no information on natural mortality within the data and hence opted to fix the value for females.  Upon additional exploration, the model estimated very little difference in male natural mortality relative to females (< 0.002) and in the interest of selecting the model that fit the data with the fewest parameters required, males were fixed equal to the female natural mortality.


###Convergence
Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. This was repeated 100 times and a better minimum was not found (Table \ref{tab:jitter}). The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base case as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.
